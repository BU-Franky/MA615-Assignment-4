766 "Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that"
766 "station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my"
766 "life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have"
766 "been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night."
766 "It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry,"
766 "simultaneously."
766 ""
766 "In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by"
766 "the nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a"
766 "lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility"
766 "of our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be"
766 "unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and"
766 "spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to"
766 "all unlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a"
766 "Friday night."
766 ""
766 "I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show"
766 "better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified"
766 "by the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only remark,"
766 "that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still"
766 "a baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all complain of"
766 "having been kept out of this property; and if anybody else should be in"
766 "the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to keep it."
766 ""
766 "I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the"
766 "newspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going"
766 "people were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and"
766 "preferred cork jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but"
766 "one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the"
766 "bill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance"
766 "in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher"
766 "bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead"
766 "loss--for as to sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry was in the"
766 "market then--and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle"
766 "down in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a"
766 "head, the winner to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I"
766 "remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of"
766 "myself being disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by"
766 "an old lady with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it"
766 "the stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny"
766 "short--as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to"
766 "endeavour without any effect to prove to her. It is a fact which will"
766 "be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned,"
766 "but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it"
766 "was, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the"
766 "water in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which"
766 "she was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation"
766 "at the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go"
766 "'meandering' about the world. It was in vain to represent to her"
766 "that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this"
766 "objectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and"
766 "with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, 'Let us"
766 "have no meandering.'"
766 ""
766 "Not to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth."
766 ""
766 "I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or 'there by', as they say in"
766 "Scotland. I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon"
766 "the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it. There is"
766 "something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw"
766 "me; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have"
766 "of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the"
766 "churchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it"
766 "lying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour"
766 "was warm and bright with fire and candle, and the doors of our house"
766 "were--almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes--bolted and locked"
766 "against it."
766 ""
766 "An aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of whom"
766 "I shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate of our"
766 "family. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always called"
766 "her, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable"
766 "personage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married"
766 "to a husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the"
766 "sense of the homely adage, 'handsome is, that handsome does'--for he"
766 "was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having"
766 "once, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined"
766 "arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs' window. These"
766 "evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him"
766 "off, and effect a separation by mutual consent. He went to India with"
766 "his capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he was"
766 "once seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but I think"
766 "it must have been a Baboo--or a Begum. Anyhow, from India tidings of his"
766 "death reached home, within ten years. How they affected my aunt, nobody"
766 "knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took her maiden name"
766 "again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off,"
766 "established herself there as a single woman with one servant, and"
766 "was understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible"
766 "retirement."
766 ""
766 "My father had once been a favourite of hers, I believe; but she was"
766 "mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was 'a"
766 "wax doll'. She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be not"
766 "yet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. He was double"
766 "my mother's age when he married, and of but a delicate constitution. He"
766 "died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came"
766 "into the world."
766 ""
766 "This was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be"
766 "excused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no"
766 "claim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood; or to"
766 "have any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what"
766 "follows."
766 ""
766 "My mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low in"
766 "spirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about"
766 "herself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by"
766 "some grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer upstairs, to a world not at"
766 "all excited on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting"
766 "by the fire, that bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and"
766 "very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her,"
766 "when, lifting her eyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she"
766 "saw a strange lady coming up the garden."
766 ""
766 "My mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was"
766 "Miss Betsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the"
766 "garden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity"
766 "of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to"
766 "nobody else."
766 ""
766 "When she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity."
766 "My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any"
766 "ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and"
766 "looked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against"
766 "the glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became"
766 "perfectly flat and white in a moment."
766 ""
766 "She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I am"
766 "indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday."
766 ""
766 "My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in"
766 "the corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly,"
766 "began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head"
766 "in a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown"
766 "and a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed, to"
766 "come and open the door. My mother went."
766 ""
766 "'Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,' said Miss Betsey; the emphasis"
766 "referring, perhaps, to my mother's mourning weeds, and her condition."
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' said my mother, faintly."
766 ""
766 "'Miss Trotwood,' said the visitor. 'You have heard of her, I dare say?'"
766 ""
766 "My mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a disagreeable"
766 "consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering"
766 "pleasure."
766 ""
766 "'Now you see her,' said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and begged"
766 "her to walk in."
766 ""
766 "They went into the parlour my mother had come from, the fire in the best"
766 "room on the other side of the passage not being lighted--not having"
766 "been lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral; and when they were both"
766 "seated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to"
766 "restrain herself, began to cry. 'Oh tut, tut, tut!' said Miss Betsey, in"
766 "a hurry. 'Don't do that! Come, come!'"
766 ""
766 "My mother couldn't help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had"
766 "had her cry out."
766 ""
766 "'Take off your cap, child,' said Miss Betsey, 'and let me see you.'"
766 ""
766 "My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd"
766 "request, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore she did as she"
766 "was told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was"
766 "luxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face."
766 ""
766 "'Why, bless my heart!' exclaimed Miss Betsey. 'You are a very Baby!'"
766 ""
766 "My mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even for her"
766 "years; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing, and said,"
766 "sobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow, and"
766 "would be but a childish mother if she lived. In a short pause which"
766 "ensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair, and"
766 "that with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid hope, she"
766 "found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up, her hands"
766 "folded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning at the fire."
766 ""
766 "'In the name of Heaven,' said Miss Betsey, suddenly, 'why Rookery?'"
766 ""
766 "'Do you mean the house, ma'am?' asked my mother."
766 ""
766 "'Why Rookery?' said Miss Betsey. 'Cookery would have been more to the"
766 "purpose, if you had had any practical ideas of life, either of you.'"
766 ""
766 "'The name was Mr. Copperfield's choice,' returned my mother. 'When he"
766 "bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks about it.'"
766 ""
766 "The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall old"
766 "elm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor Miss"
766 "Betsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms bent to one another,"
766 "like giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such"
766 "repose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if"
766 "their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind,"
766 "some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks'-nests, burdening their higher"
766 "branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea."
766 ""
766 "'Where are the birds?' asked Miss Betsey."
766 ""
766 "'The--?' My mother had been thinking of something else."
766 ""
766 "'The rooks--what has become of them?' asked Miss Betsey."
766 ""
766 "'There have not been any since we have lived here,' said my mother. 'We"
766 "thought--Mr. Copperfield thought--it was quite a large rookery; but"
766 "the nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a long"
766 "while.'"
766 ""
766 "'David Copperfield all over!' cried Miss Betsey. 'David Copperfield from"
766 "head to foot! Calls a house a rookery when there's not a rook near it,"
766 "and takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests!'"
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Copperfield,' returned my mother, 'is dead, and if you dare to"
766 "speak unkindly of him to me--'"
766 ""
766 "My poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention of"
766 "committing an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have"
766 "settled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far better"
766 "training for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed"
766 "with the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very"
766 "meekly, and fainted."
766 ""
766 "When she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her,"
766 "whichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The"
766 "twilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as they"
766 "saw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the"
766 "fire."
766 ""
766 "'Well?' said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only"
766 "been taking a casual look at the prospect; 'and when do you expect--'"
766 ""
766 "'I am all in a tremble,' faltered my mother. 'I don't know what's the"
766 "matter. I shall die, I am sure!'"
766 ""
766 "'No, no, no,' said Miss Betsey. 'Have some tea.'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good?' cried my"
766 "mother in a helpless manner."
766 ""
766 "'Of course it will,' said Miss Betsey. 'It's nothing but fancy. What do"
766 "you call your girl?'"
766 ""
766 "'I don't know that it will be a girl, yet, ma'am,' said my mother"
766 "innocently."
766 ""
766 "'Bless the Baby!' exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting the"
766 "second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs, but"
766 "applying it to my mother instead of me, 'I don't mean that. I mean your"
766 "servant-girl.'"
766 ""
766 "'Peggotty,' said my mother."
766 ""
766 "'Peggotty!' repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation. 'Do you mean to"
766 "say, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian church,"
766 "and got herself named Peggotty?' 'It's her surname,' said my mother,"
766 "faintly. 'Mr. Copperfield called her by it, because her Christian name"
766 "was the same as mine.'"
766 ""
766 "'Here! Peggotty!' cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlour door. 'Tea."
766 "Your mistress is a little unwell. Don't dawdle.'"
766 ""
766 "Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been"
766 "a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house,"
766 "and having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the"
766 "passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey shut"
766 "the door again, and sat down as before: with her feet on the fender, the"
766 "skirt of her dress tucked up, and her hands folded on one knee."
766 ""
766 "'You were speaking about its being a girl,' said Miss Betsey. 'I have no"
766 "doubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a girl."
766 "Now child, from the moment of the birth of this girl--'"
766 ""
766 "'Perhaps boy,' my mother took the liberty of putting in."
766 ""
766 "'I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl,' returned Miss"
766 "Betsey. 'Don't contradict. From the moment of this girl's birth, child,"
766 "I intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, and I beg"
766 "you'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must be no mistakes"
766 "in life with THIS Betsey Trotwood. There must be no trifling with HER"
766 "affections, poor dear. She must be well brought up, and well guarded"
766 "from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved. I"
766 "must make that MY care.'"
766 ""
766 "There was a twitch of Miss Betsey's head, after each of these sentences,"
766 "as if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any"
766 "plainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected,"
766 "at least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire: too"
766 "much scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and"
766 "bewildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what"
766 "to say."
766 ""
766 "'And was David good to you, child?' asked Miss Betsey, when she had been"
766 "silent for a little while, and these motions of her head had gradually"
766 "ceased. 'Were you comfortable together?'"
766 ""
766 "'We were very happy,' said my mother. 'Mr. Copperfield was only too good"
766 "to me.'"
766 ""
766 "'What, he spoilt you, I suppose?' returned Miss Betsey."
766 ""
766 "'For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world"
766 "again, yes, I fear he did indeed,' sobbed my mother."
766 ""
766 "'Well! Don't cry!' said Miss Betsey. 'You were not equally matched,"
766 "child--if any two people can be equally matched--and so I asked the"
766 "question. You were an orphan, weren't you?' 'Yes.'"
766 ""
766 "'And a governess?'"
766 ""
766 "'I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to"
766 "visit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of"
766 "notice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed"
766 "to me. And I accepted him. And so we were married,' said my mother"
766 "simply."
766 ""
766 "'Ha! Poor Baby!' mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon the"
766 "fire. 'Do you know anything?'"
766 ""
766 "'I beg your pardon, ma'am,' faltered my mother."
766 ""
766 "'About keeping house, for instance,' said Miss Betsey."
766 ""
766 "'Not much, I fear,' returned my mother. 'Not so much as I could wish."
766 "But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me--'"
766 ""
766 "('Much he knew about it himself!') said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis."
766 "--'And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn, and"
766 "he very patient to teach me, if the great misfortune of his death'--my"
766 "mother broke down again here, and could get no farther."
766 ""
766 "'Well, well!' said Miss Betsey. --'I kept my housekeeping-book"
766 "regularly, and balanced it with Mr. Copperfield every night,' cried my"
766 "mother in another burst of distress, and breaking down again."
766 ""
766 "'Well, well!' said Miss Betsey. 'Don't cry any more.' --'And I am"
766 "sure we never had a word of difference respecting it, except when Mr."
766 "Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each"
766 "other, or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines,' resumed my"
766 "mother in another burst, and breaking down again."
766 ""
766 "'You'll make yourself ill,' said Miss Betsey, 'and you know that will"
766 "not be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come! You mustn't do"
766 "it!'"
766 ""
766 "This argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her"
766 "increasing indisposition had a larger one. There was an interval of"
766 "silence, only broken by Miss Betsey's occasionally ejaculating 'Ha!' as"
766 "she sat with her feet upon the fender."
766 ""
766 "'David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,' said"
766 "she, by and by. 'What did he do for you?'"
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Copperfield,' said my mother, answering with some difficulty, 'was"
766 "so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to"
766 "me.'"
766 ""
766 "'How much?' asked Miss Betsey."
766 ""
766 "'A hundred and five pounds a year,' said my mother."
766 ""
766 "'He might have done worse,' said my aunt."
766 ""
766 "The word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much worse"
766 "that Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and seeing at a"
766 "glance how ill she was,--as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if there"
766 "had been light enough,--conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all"
766 "speed; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew, who had been"
766 "for some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my mother, as a"
766 "special messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse and doctor."
766 ""
766 "Those allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived"
766 "within a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of"
766 "portentous appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied"
766 "over her left arm, stopping her ears with jewellers' cotton. Peggotty"
766 "knowing nothing about her, and my mother saying nothing about her,"
766 "she was quite a mystery in the parlour; and the fact of her having a"
766 "magazine of jewellers' cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article"
766 "in her ears in that way, did not detract from the solemnity of her"
766 "presence."
766 ""
766 "The doctor having been upstairs and come down again, and having"
766 "satisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this"
766 "unknown lady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for some"
766 "hours, laid himself out to be polite and social. He was the meekest of"
766 "his sex, the mildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to"
766 "take up the less space. He walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet,"
766 "and more slowly. He carried his head on one side, partly in modest"
766 "depreciation of himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody"
766 "else. It is nothing to say that he hadn't a word to throw at a dog. He"
766 "couldn't have thrown a word at a mad dog. He might have offered him one"
766 "gently, or half a one, or a fragment of one; for he spoke as slowly as"
766 "he walked; but he wouldn't have been rude to him, and he couldn't have"
766 "been quick with him, for any earthly consideration."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side, and"
766 "making her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers' cotton, as"
766 "he softly touched his left ear:"
766 ""
766 "'Some local irritation, ma'am?'"
766 ""
766 "'What!' replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness--as he told my mother"
766 "afterwards--that it was a mercy he didn't lose his presence of mind. But"
766 "he repeated sweetly:"
766 ""
766 "'Some local irritation, ma'am?'"
766 ""
766 "'Nonsense!' replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one blow."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly,"
766 "as she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called upstairs again."
766 "After some quarter of an hour's absence, he returned."
766 ""
766 "'Well?' said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him."
766 ""
766 "'Well, ma'am,' returned Mr. Chillip, 'we are--we are progressing slowly,"
766 "ma'am.'"
766 ""
766 "'Ba--a--ah!' said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous"
766 "interjection. And corked herself as before."
766 ""
766 "Really--really--as Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked;"
766 "speaking in a professional point of view alone, he was almost shocked."
766 "But he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours,"
766 "as she sat looking at the fire, until he was again called out. After"

766 "'Well?' said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again."

766 "ma'am.'"
766 ""
766 "'Ya--a--ah!' said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. Chillip"
766 "absolutely could not bear it. It was really calculated to break his"
766 "spirit, he said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs,"
766 "in the dark and a strong draught, until he was again sent for."
766 ""
766 "Ham Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very dragon at"
766 "his catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness,"
766 "reported next day, that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour"
766 "after this, he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey, then walking to"
766 "and fro in a state of agitation, and pounced upon before he could make"
766 "his escape. That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices"
766 "overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude, from the"
766 "circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on"
766 "whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest."
766 "That, marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had"
766 "been taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled"
766 "his hair, made light of his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded"
766 "them with her own, and otherwise tousled and maltreated him. This was"
766 "in part confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half past twelve o'clock,"
766 "soon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was."
766 ""
766 "The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if"
766 "at any time. He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty,"
766 "and said to my aunt in his meekest manner:"
766 ""
766 "'Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you.'"
766 ""
766 "'What upon?' said my aunt, sharply."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Chillip was fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt's"
766 "manner; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to"
766 "mollify her."
766 ""
766 "'Mercy on the man, what's he doing!' cried my aunt, impatiently. 'Can't"
766 "he speak?'"
766 ""
766 "'Be calm, my dear ma'am,' said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents."
766 ""
766 "'There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma'am. Be calm.'"
766 ""
766 "It has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn't shake"
766 "him, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook her own"
766 "head at him, but in a way that made him quail."
766 ""
766 "'Well, ma'am,' resumed Mr. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, 'I am"
766 "happy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma'am, and well over.'"
766 ""
766 "During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery"
766 "of this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly."
766 ""
766 "'How is she?' said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet still tied"
766 "on one of them."
766 ""
766 "'Well, ma'am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope,' returned Mr."
766 "Chillip. 'Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be,"
766 "under these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot be any"
766 "objection to your seeing her presently, ma'am. It may do her good.'"
766 ""
766 "'And SHE. How is SHE?' said my aunt, sharply."

766 "My aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in the"
766 "manner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip's head with it, put it on"
766 "bent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a discontented"
766 "fairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it was popularly"
766 "supposed I was entitled to see; and never came back any more."
766 ""
766 "No. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey"

766 "tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the light upon"

766 ""
766 "The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look"
766 "far back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty"
766 "hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so"
766 "dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face,"
766 "and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn't"
766 "peck her in preference to apples."
766 ""
766 "I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed"
766 "to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going"
766 "unsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind"
766 "which I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of"
766 "Peggotty's forefinger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its being"
766 "roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater."
766 ""
766 "This may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go"
766 "farther back into such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe"
766 "the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite"
766 "wonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that most"
766 "grown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater propriety"
766 "be said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it; the"
766 "rather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness,"
766 "and gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an"
766 "inheritance they have preserved from their childhood."
766 ""
766 "I might have a misgiving that I am 'meandering' in stopping to say this,"
766 "but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in part"
766 "upon my own experience of myself; and if it should appear from"
766 "anything I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close"
766 "observation, or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood, I"
766 "undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics."
766 ""
766 "Looking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first"
766 "objects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of"
766 "things, are my mother and Peggotty. What else do I remember? Let me see."
766 ""
766 ""
766 "There comes out of the cloud, our house--not new to me, but quite"
766 "familiar, in its earliest remembrance. On the ground-floor is Peggotty's"
766 "kitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in"
766 "the centre, without any pigeons in it; a great dog-kennel in a corner,"
766 "without any dog; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me,"
766 "walking about, in a menacing and ferocious manner. There is one cock who"
766 "gets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of me as"
766 "I look at him through the kitchen window, who makes me shiver, he is so"
766 "fierce. Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after"
766 "me with their long necks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at"
766 "night: as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions."
766 ""
766 "Here is a long passage--what an enormous perspective I make of"
766 "it!--leading from Peggotty's kitchen to the front door. A dark"
766 "store-room opens out of it, and that is a place to be run past at"
766 "night; for I don't know what may be among those tubs and jars and old"
766 "tea-chests, when there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light,"
766 "letting a mouldy air come out of the door, in which there is the smell"
766 "of soap, pickles, pepper, candles, and coffee, all at one whiff. Then"
766 "there are the two parlours: the parlour in which we sit of an evening,"
766 "my mother and I and Peggotty--for Peggotty is quite our companion, when"
766 "her work is done and we are alone--and the best parlour where we sit"
766 "on a Sunday; grandly, but not so comfortably. There is something of a"
766 "doleful air about that room to me, for Peggotty has told me--I don't"
766 "know when, but apparently ages ago--about my father's funeral, and the"
766 "company having their black cloaks put on. One Sunday night my mother"
766 "reads to Peggotty and me in there, how Lazarus was raised up from the"
766 "dead. And I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me"
766 "out of bed, and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window,"
766 "with the dead all lying in their graves at rest, below the solemn moon."
766 ""
766 "There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of"
766 "that churchyard; nothing half so shady as its trees; nothing half so"
766 "quiet as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel up,"
766 "early in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within my mother's"
766 "room, to look out at it; and I see the red light shining on the"
766 "sun-dial, and think within myself, 'Is the sun-dial glad, I wonder, that"
766 "it can tell the time again?'"
766 ""
766 "Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a window"
766 "near it, out of which our house can be seen, and IS seen many times"
766 "during the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes to make herself"
766 "as sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not in flames. But"
766 "though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much offended if mine does,"
766 "and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to look at the"
766 "clergyman. But I can't always look at him--I know him without that white"
766 "thing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and perhaps"
766 "stopping the service to inquire--and what am I to do? It's a dreadful"
766 "thing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my mother, but she"
766 "pretends not to see me. I look at a boy in the aisle, and he makes faces"
766 "at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through"
766 "the porch, and there I see a stray sheep--I don't mean a sinner, but"
766 "mutton--half making up his mind to come into the church. I feel that"
766 "if I looked at him any longer, I might be tempted to say something out"
766 "loud; and what would become of me then! I look up at the monumental"
766 "tablets on the wall, and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this"
766 "parish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been, when"
766 "affliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physicians were in"
766 "vain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain;"
766 "and if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week. I look from"
766 "Mr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit; and think what a"
766 "good place it would be to play in, and what a castle it would make, with"
766 "another boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and having the velvet"
766 "cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head. In time my eyes"
766 "gradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a"
766 "drowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I fall off the seat with"
766 "a crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive, by Peggotty."
766 ""
766 "And now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed"
766 "bedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the"
766 "ragged old rooks'-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom"
766 "of the front garden. Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond the"
766 "yard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are--a very preserve"
766 "of butterflies, as I remember it, with a high fence, and a gate and"
766 "padlock; where the fruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer than"
766 "fruit has ever been since, in any other garden, and where my"
766 "mother gathers some in a basket, while I stand by, bolting furtive"
766 "gooseberries, and trying to look unmoved. A great wind rises, and the"
766 "summer is gone in a moment. We are playing in the winter twilight,"
766 "dancing about the parlour. When my mother is out of breath and rests"
766 "herself in an elbow-chair, I watch her winding her bright curls round"
766 "her fingers, and straitening her waist, and nobody knows better than I"
766 "do that she likes to look so well, and is proud of being so pretty."
766 ""
766 "That is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that we"
766 "were both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most"
766 "things to her direction, were among the first opinions--if they may be"
766 "so called--that I ever derived from what I saw."
766 ""
766 "Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire, alone. I"
766 "had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read very"
766 "perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I"
766 "remember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they were"
766 "a sort of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead sleepy; but"
766 "having leave, as a high treat, to sit up until my mother came home from"
766 "spending the evening at a neighbour's, I would rather have died upon"
766 "my post (of course) than have gone to bed. I had reached that stage of"
766 "sleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large."
766 "I propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers, and looked"
766 "perseveringly at her as she sat at work; at the little bit of wax-candle"
766 "she kept for her thread--how old it looked, being so wrinkled in"
766 "all directions!--at the little house with a thatched roof, where the"
766 "yard-measure lived; at her work-box with a sliding lid, with a view of"
766 "St. Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted on the top; at the brass"
766 "thimble on her finger; at herself, whom I thought lovely. I felt so"
766 "sleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment, I was"
766 "gone."
766 ""
766 "'Peggotty,' says I, suddenly, 'were you ever married?'"
766 ""
766 "'Lord, Master Davy,' replied Peggotty. 'What's put marriage in your"
766 "head?'"
766 ""
766 "She answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then she"
766 "stopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its"
766 "thread's length."
766 ""
766 "'But WERE you ever married, Peggotty?' says I. 'You are a very handsome"
766 "woman, an't you?'"
766 ""
766 "I thought her in a different style from my mother, certainly; but of"
766 "another school of beauty, I considered her a perfect example. There"
766 "was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour, on which my mother"
766 "had painted a nosegay. The ground-work of that stool, and Peggotty's"
766 "complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing. The stool was"
766 "smooth, and Peggotty was rough, but that made no difference."
766 ""
766 "'Me handsome, Davy!' said Peggotty. 'Lawk, no, my dear! But what put"
766 "marriage in your head?'"
766 ""

766 "you, Peggotty?'"
766 ""
766 "'Certainly not,' says Peggotty, with the promptest decision."
766 ""

766 "another person, mayn't you, Peggotty?'"
766 ""

766 "curiously at me."
766 ""
766 "'My opinion is,' said Peggotty, taking her eyes from me, after a little"
766 "indecision and going on with her work, 'that I never was married myself,"
766 "Master Davy, and that I don't expect to be. That's all I know about the"
766 "subject.'"
766 ""
766 "'You an't cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you?' said I, after sitting"
766 "quiet for a minute."
766 ""
766 "I really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was quite"
766 "mistaken: for she laid aside her work (which was a stocking of her own),"
766 "and opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and gave it"
766 "a good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, because, being very plump,"
766 "whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed, some of the"
766 "buttons on the back of her gown flew off. And I recollect two bursting"
766 "to the opposite side of the parlour, while she was hugging me."
766 ""
766 "'Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills,' said Peggotty, who"
766 "was not quite right in the name yet, 'for I an't heard half enough.'"

766 "was so ready to go back to the crocodiles. However, we returned to those"
766 "monsters, with fresh wakefulness on my part, and we left their eggs in"
766 "the sand for the sun to hatch; and we ran away from them, and baffled"
766 "them by constantly turning, which they were unable to do quickly, on"
766 "account of their unwieldy make; and we went into the water after them,"
766 "as natives, and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats; and in"
766 "short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. I did, at least; but I had"
766 "my doubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into"
766 "various parts of her face and arms, all the time."
766 ""
766 "We had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when"
766 "the garden-bell rang. We went out to the door; and there was my mother,"

766 "beautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from"
766 "church last Sunday."
766 ""
766 "As my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and"
766 "kiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow"

766 "comes, I am sensible, to my aid here."

766 "'What does that mean?' I asked him, over her shoulder."

766 "He patted me on the head; but somehow, I didn't like him or his deep"

766 "gently chid me for being rude; and, keeping me close to her shawl,"
766 "turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her"
766 "home. She put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with"
766 "his own, she glanced, I thought, at me."
766 ""
766 "'Let us say \"good night\", my fine boy,' said the gentleman, when he had"
766 "bent his head--I saw him!--over my mother's little glove."

766 "wounded tenderness I called Peggotty a 'Beast'. That honest creature was"
766 "in deep affliction, I remember, and must have become quite buttonless"
766 "on the occasion; for a little volley of those explosives went off,"

766 "to look at a famous geranium we had, in the parlour-window. It did not"
766 "appear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he asked"
766 "my mother to give him a bit of the blossom. She begged him to choose it"
766 "for himself, but he refused to do that--I could not understand why--so"

766 "instinctive dislike, and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make"
766 "much of my mother without any help, it certainly was not THE reason that"

766 "express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into--which, when"

766 "of the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me of"

766 "lived in, I might have thought it small, or inconvenient, or lonely; but"
766 "never having been designed for any such use, it became a perfect abode."
766 ""
766 "It was beautifully clean inside, and as tidy as possible. There was a"
766 "table, and a Dutch clock, and a chest of drawers, and on the chest of"
766 "drawers there was a tea-tray with a painting on it of a lady with a"
766 "parasol, taking a walk with a military-looking child who was trundling a"
766 "hoop. The tray was kept from tumbling down, by a bible; and the tray, if"
766 "it had tumbled down, would have smashed a quantity of cups and saucers"
766 "and a teapot that were grouped around the book. On the walls there were"
766 "some common coloured pictures, framed and glazed, of scripture subjects;"
766 "such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars, without seeing"
766 "the whole interior of Peggotty's brother's house again, at one view."
766 "Abraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow"
766 "cast into a den of green lions, were the most prominent of these. Over"
766 "the little mantelshelf, was a picture of the 'Sarah Jane' lugger, built"
766 "at Sunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it; a work of"
766 "art, combining composition with carpentry, which I considered to be one"
766 "of the most enviable possessions that the world could afford. There"
766 "were some hooks in the beams of the ceiling, the use of which I did not"
766 "divine then; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort,"
766 "which served for seats and eked out the chairs."
766 ""
766 "All this I saw in the first glance after I crossed the"
766 "threshold--child-like, according to my theory--and then Peggotty opened"
766 "a little door and showed me my bedroom. It was the completest and most"
766 "desirable bedroom ever seen--in the stern of the vessel; with a little"
766 "window, where the rudder used to go through; a little looking-glass,"
766 "just the right height for me, nailed against the wall, and framed with"
766 "oyster-shells; a little bed, which there was just room enough to get"
766 "into; and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table. The walls"
766 "were whitewashed as white as milk, and the patchwork counterpane made my"
766 "eyes quite ache with its brightness. One thing I particularly noticed"
766 "in this delightful house, was the smell of fish; which was so searching,"
766 "that when I took out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose, I found it"
766 "smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster. On my imparting this"
766 "discovery in confidence to Peggotty, she informed me that her brother"
766 "dealt in lobsters, crabs, and crawfish; and I afterwards found that a"
766 "heap of these creatures, in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one"
766 "another, and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of,"
766 "were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and"
766 "kettles were kept."
766 ""
766 "We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron, whom I had seen"
766 "curtseying at the door when I was on Ham's back, about a quarter of a"
766 "mile off. Likewise by a most beautiful little girl (or I thought her so)"
766 "with a necklace of blue beads on, who wouldn't let me kiss her when I"
766 "offered to, but ran away and hid herself. By and by, when we had dined"
766 "in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs, melted butter, and potatoes, with"
766 "a chop for me, a hairy man with a very good-natured face came home. As"
766 "he called Peggotty 'Lass', and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek, I"
766 "had no doubt, from the general propriety of her conduct, that he was her"
766 "brother; and so he turned out--being presently introduced to me as Mr."
766 "Peggotty, the master of the house."
766 ""
766 "'Glad to see you, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'You'll find us rough, sir,"
766 "but you'll find us ready.'"

766 "I thanked him, and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such a"
766 "delightful place."
766 ""
766 "'How's your Ma, sir?' said Mr. Peggotty. 'Did you leave her pretty"
766 "jolly?'"
766 ""
766 "I gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I could wish,"
766 "and that she desired her compliments--which was a polite fiction on my"
766 "part."

766 "'I'm much obleeged to her, I'm sure,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'Well, sir,"
766 "if you can make out here, fur a fortnut, 'long wi' her,' nodding at his"
766 "sister, 'and Ham, and little Em'ly, we shall be proud of your company.'"
766 ""
766 "Having done the honours of his house in this hospitable manner, Mr."
766 "Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water, remarking"
766 "that 'cold would never get his muck off'. He soon returned, greatly"
766 "improved in appearance; but so rubicund, that I couldn't help"
766 "thinking his face had this in common with the lobsters, crabs, and"
766 "crawfish,--that it went into the hot water very black, and came out very"

766 "After tea, when the door was shut and all was made snug (the nights"
766 "being cold and misty now), it seemed to me the most delicious retreat"

766 "up out at sea, to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat"
766 "outside, and to look at the fire, and think that there was no house near"
766 "but this one, and this one a boat, was like enchantment. Little Em'ly"
766 "had overcome her shyness, and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and"
766 "least of the lockers, which was just large enough for us two, and just"
766 "fitted into the chimney corner. Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron, was"
766 "knitting on the opposite side of the fire. Peggotty at her needlework"
766 "was as much at home with St. Paul's and the bit of wax-candle, as if"
766 "they had never known any other roof. Ham, who had been giving me my"
766 "first lesson in all-fours, was trying to recollect a scheme of telling"
766 "fortunes with the dirty cards, and was printing off fishy impressions of"
766 "his thumb on all the cards he turned. Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe."
766 "I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence."

766 ""
766 "'Haven't you ANY children, Mr. Peggotty?'"
766 ""

766 "impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions, that I could"
766 "only sit and look at all the silent company, until it was time to go to"
766 "bed. Then, in the privacy of my own little cabin, she informed me that"
766 "Ham and Em'ly were an orphan nephew and niece, whom my host had"
766 "at different times adopted in their childhood, when they were left"
766 "destitute: and that Mrs. Gummidge was the widow of his partner in"
766 "a boat, who had died very poor. He was but a poor man himself, said"
766 "Peggotty, but as good as gold and as true as steel--those were her"
766 "similes. The only subject, she informed me, on which he ever showed a"
766 "violent temper or swore an oath, was this generosity of his; and if it"
766 "were ever referred to, by any one of them, he struck the table a heavy"
766 "blow with his right hand (had split it on one such occasion), and swore"
766 "a dreadful oath that he would be 'Gormed' if he didn't cut and run"
766 "for good, if it was ever mentioned again. It appeared, in answer to"
766 "my inquiries, that nobody had the least idea of the etymology of this"
766 "terrible verb passive to be gormed; but that they all regarded it as"
766 "constituting a most solemn imprecation."
766 ""
766 "I was very sensible of my entertainer's goodness, and listened to the"
766 "women's going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite"
766 "end of the boat, and to him and Ham hanging up two hammocks for"
766 "themselves on the hooks I had noticed in the roof, in a very luxurious"
766 "state of mind, enhanced by my being sleepy. As slumber gradually stole"
766 "upon me, I heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the"
766 "flat so fiercely, that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep"
766 "rising in the night. But I bethought myself that I was in a boat, after"
766 "all; and that a man like Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on"
766 "board if anything did happen."
766 ""
766 "Nothing happened, however, worse than morning. Almost as soon as it"
766 "shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, and out"
766 "with little Em'ly, picking up stones upon the beach."
766 ""
766 "'You're quite a sailor, I suppose?' I said to Em'ly. I don't know that I"
766 "supposed anything of the kind, but I felt it an act of gallantry to"
766 "say something; and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little"
766 "image of itself, at the moment, in her bright eye, that it came into my"
766 "head to say this."
766 ""
766 "'No,' replied Em'ly, shaking her head, 'I'm afraid of the sea.'"
766 ""

766 "at the mighty ocean. 'I an't!'"
766 ""
766 "'Ah! but it's cruel,' said Em'ly. 'I have seen it very cruel to some of"
766 "our men. I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house, all to pieces.'"
766 ""
766 "'I hope it wasn't the boat that--'"
766 ""
766 "'That father was drownded in?' said Em'ly. 'No. Not that one, I never"

766 "Little Em'ly shook her head. 'Not to remember!'"

766 "Here was a coincidence! I immediately went into an explanation how I had"
766 "never seen my own father; and how my mother and I had always lived"
766 "by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable, and lived so then, and"
766 "always meant to live so; and how my father's grave was in the churchyard"
766 "near our house, and shaded by a tree, beneath the boughs of which I had"
766 "walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning. But there were"
766 "some differences between Em'ly's orphanhood and mine, it appeared. She"
766 "had lost her mother before her father; and where her father's grave was"
766 "no one knew, except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea."
766 ""
766 "'Besides,' said Em'ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles, 'your"

766 "a fisherman.'"

766 ""
766 "'Yes. I mean him. He must be very good, I should think?'"
766 ""
766 "'Good?' said Em'ly. 'If I was ever to be a lady, I'd give him a sky-blue"
766 "coat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat, a"
766 "cocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of money.'"
766 ""
766 "I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures."

766 "ease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece, and"
766 "that I was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat; but I"
766 "kept these sentiments to myself."
766 ""
766 "Little Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration"
766 "of these articles, as if they were a glorious vision. We went on again,"

766 "for the poor fishermen's, to be sure, and we'd help 'em with money when"
766 "they come to any hurt.' This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and"
766 "therefore not at all improbable picture. I expressed my pleasure in the"
766 "contemplation of it, and little Em'ly was emboldened to say, shyly,"
766 ""
766 "'Don't you think you are afraid of the sea, now?'"
766 ""
766 "It was quiet enough to reassure me, but I have no doubt if I had seen a"
766 "moderately large wave come tumbling in, I should have taken to my heels,"
766 "with an awful recollection of her drowned relations. However, I said"
766 "'No,' and I added, 'You don't seem to be either, though you say you"
766 "are,'--for she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of old"
766 "jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon, and I was afraid of her"

766 "She started from my side, and ran along a jagged timber which protruded"

766 "times since, in my manhood, many times there have been, when I have"
766 "thought, Is it possible, among the possibilities of hidden things, that"
766 "in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off, there"
766 "was any merciful attraction of her into danger, any tempting her towards"
766 "him permitted on the part of her dead father, that her life might have"
766 "a chance of ending that day? There has been a time since when I have"
766 "wondered whether, if the life before her could have been revealed to me"
766 "at a glance, and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it,"
766 "and if her preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand, I"

766 "'I'm sorry I should drive you there,' said Mrs. Gummidge."
766 ""
766 "'Drive! I don't want no driving,' returned Mr. Peggotty with an honest"
766 "laugh. 'I only go too ready.'"

766 "'Very ready,' said Mrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, and wiping her eyes."

766 "'Along o' you! It an't along o' you!' said Mr. Peggotty. 'Don't ye"

766 "'Yes, yes, it is,' cried Mrs. Gummidge. 'I know what I am. I know that I"
766 "am a lone lorn creetur', and not only that everythink goes contrary with"
766 "me, but that I go contrary with everybody. Yes, yes. I feel more than"
766 "other people do, and I show it more. It's my misfortun'.'"
766 ""
766 "I really couldn't help thinking, as I sat taking in all this, that the"
766 "misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides Mrs."
766 "Gummidge. But Mr. Peggotty made no such retort, only answering with"
766 "another entreaty to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up."
766 ""
766 "'I an't what I could wish myself to be,' said Mrs. Gummidge. 'I am far"
766 "from it. I know what I am. My troubles has made me contrary. I feel my"
766 "troubles, and they make me contrary. I wish I didn't feel 'em, but I"
766 "do. I wish I could be hardened to 'em, but I an't. I make the house"
766 "uncomfortable. I don't wonder at it. I've made your sister so all day,"
766 "and Master Davy.'"
766 ""
766 "Here I was suddenly melted, and roared out, 'No, you haven't, Mrs."
766 "Gummidge,' in great mental distress."
766 ""
766 "'It's far from right that I should do it,' said Mrs. Gummidge. 'It an't"
766 "a fit return. I had better go into the house and die. I am a lone lorn"
766 "creetur', and had much better not make myself contrary here. If thinks"
766 "must go contrary with me, and I must go contrary myself, let me go"
766 "contrary in my parish. Dan'l, I'd better go into the house, and die and"
766 "be a riddance!'"
766 ""
766 "Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words, and betook herself to bed. When"
766 "she was gone, Mr. Peggotty, who had not exhibited a trace of any feeling"
766 "but the profoundest sympathy, looked round upon us, and nodding his head"
766 "with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face,"
766 "said in a whisper:"
766 ""
766 "'She's been thinking of the old 'un!'"
766 ""
766 "I did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was supposed to"
766 "have fixed her mind upon, until Peggotty, on seeing me to bed, explained"
766 "that it was the late Mr. Gummidge; and that her brother always took that"
766 "for a received truth on such occasions, and that it always had a moving"
766 "effect upon him. Some time after he was in his hammock that night, I"
766 "heard him myself repeat to Ham, 'Poor thing! She's been thinking of the"
766 "old 'un!' And whenever Mrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner"
766 "during the remainder of our stay (which happened some few times), he"
766 "always said the same thing in extenuation of the circumstance, and"
766 "always with the tenderest commiseration."
766 ""
766 "So the fortnight slipped away, varied by nothing but the variation of"
766 "the tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty's times of going out and coming in,"
766 "and altered Ham's engagements also. When the latter was unemployed, he"
766 "sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships, and once"
766 "or twice he took us for a row. I don't know why one slight set of"
766 "impressions should be more particularly associated with a place than"
766 "another, though I believe this obtains with most people, in reference"
766 "especially to the associations of their childhood. I never hear the"
766 "name, or read the name, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded of a certain"
766 "Sunday morning on the beach, the bells ringing for church, little Em'ly"
766 "leaning on my shoulder, Ham lazily dropping stones into the water, and"
766 "the sun, away at sea, just breaking through the heavy mist, and showing"
766 "us the ships, like their own shadows."
766 ""
766 "At last the day came for going home. I bore up against the separation"
766 "from Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge, but my agony of mind at leaving"
766 "little Em'ly was piercing. We went arm-in-arm to the public-house where"
766 "the carrier put up, and I promised, on the road, to write to her. (I"
766 "redeemed that promise afterwards, in characters larger than those in"
766 "which apartments are usually announced in manuscript, as being to let.)"
766 "We were greatly overcome at parting; and if ever, in my life, I have had"
766 "a void made in my heart, I had one made that day."
766 ""
766 "Now, all the time I had been on my visit, I had been ungrateful to my"
766 "home again, and had thought little or nothing about it. But I was no"
766 "sooner turned towards it, than my reproachful young conscience seemed"
766 "to point that way with a ready finger; and I felt, all the more for the"
766 "sinking of my spirits, that it was my nest, and that my mother was my"
766 "comforter and friend."
766 ""
766 "This gained upon me as we went along; so that the nearer we drew, the"
766 "more familiar the objects became that we passed, the more excited I was"
766 "to get there, and to run into her arms. But Peggotty, instead of sharing"
766 "in those transports, tried to check them (though very kindly), and"
766 "looked confused and out of sorts."
766 ""
766 "Blunderstone Rookery would come, however, in spite of her, when the"
766 "carrier's horse pleased--and did. How well I recollect it, on a cold"
766 "grey afternoon, with a dull sky, threatening rain!"
766 ""
766 "The door opened, and I looked, half laughing and half crying in my"
766 "pleasant agitation, for my mother. It was not she, but a strange"
766 "servant."

766 ""
766 "'Yes, yes, Master Davy,' said Peggotty. 'She's come home. Wait a bit,"
766 "Master Davy, and I'll--I'll tell you something.'"
766 ""
766 "Between her agitation, and her natural awkwardness in getting out of the"
766 "cart, Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself, but"
766 "I felt too blank and strange to tell her so. When she had got down, she"
766 "took me by the hand; led me, wondering, into the kitchen; and shut the"
766 "door."
766 ""
766 "'Peggotty!' said I, quite frightened. 'What's the matter?'"
766 ""
766 "'Nothing's the matter, bless you, Master Davy dear!' she answered,"
766 "assuming an air of sprightliness."
766 ""
766 "'Something's the matter, I'm sure. Where's mama?'"
766 ""
766 "'Where's mama, Master Davy?' repeated Peggotty."
766 ""
766 "'Yes. Why hasn't she come out to the gate, and what have we come in here"
766 "for? Oh, Peggotty!' My eyes were full, and I felt as if I were going to"
766 "tumble down."
766 ""
766 "'Bless the precious boy!' cried Peggotty, taking hold of me. 'What is"
766 "it? Speak, my pet!'"
766 ""
766 "'Not dead, too! Oh, she's not dead, Peggotty?'"
766 ""
766 "Peggotty cried out No! with an astonishing volume of voice; and then sat"
766 "down, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn."
766 ""
766 "I gave her a hug to take away the turn, or to give her another turn"
766 "in the right direction, and then stood before her, looking at her in"
766 "anxious inquiry."
766 ""
766 "'You see, dear, I should have told you before now,' said Peggotty,"
766 "'but I hadn't an opportunity. I ought to have made it, perhaps, but"
766 "I couldn't azackly'--that was always the substitute for exactly, in"
766 "Peggotty's militia of words--'bring my mind to it.'"
766 ""
766 "'Go on, Peggotty,' said I, more frightened than before."
766 ""
766 "'Master Davy,' said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking hand,"
766 "and speaking in a breathless sort of way. 'What do you think? You have"
766 "got a Pa!'"
766 ""
766 "I trembled, and turned white. Something--I don't know what, or"
766 "how--connected with the grave in the churchyard, and the raising of the"
766 "dead, seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind."
766 ""
766 "'A new one,' said Peggotty."
766 ""
766 "'A new one?' I repeated."
766 ""
766 "Peggotty gave a gasp, as if she were swallowing something that was very"
766 "hard, and, putting out her hand, said:"
766 ""
766 "'Come and see him.'"
766 ""
766 "'I don't want to see him.' --'And your mama,' said Peggotty."

766 "I ceased to draw back, and we went straight to the best parlour, where"
766 "she left me. On one side of the fire, sat my mother; on the other, Mr."
766 "Murdstone. My mother dropped her work, and arose hurriedly, but timidly"
766 "I thought."
766 ""
766 "'Now, Clara my dear,' said Mr. Murdstone. 'Recollect! control yourself,"
766 "always control yourself! Davy boy, how do you do?'"
766 ""
766 "I gave him my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed my"
766 "mother: she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and sat down"
766 "again to her work. I could not look at her, I could not look at him,"
766 "I knew quite well that he was looking at us both; and I turned to the"
766 "window and looked out there, at some shrubs that were drooping their"
766 "heads in the cold."
766 ""
766 "As soon as I could creep away, I crept upstairs. My old dear bedroom was"
766 "changed, and I was to lie a long way off. I rambled downstairs to find"
766 "anything that was like itself, so altered it all seemed; and roamed into"
766 "the yard. I very soon started back from there, for the empty dog-kennel"
766 "was filled up with a great dog--deep mouthed and black-haired like"

766 "the window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect, of the"
766 "washing-stand being rickety on its three legs, and having a discontented"

766 "influence of the old one. I was crying all the time, but, except that I"
766 "was conscious of being cold and dejected, I am sure I never thought"
766 "why I cried. At last in my desolation I began to consider that I was"
766 "dreadfully in love with little Em'ly, and had been torn away from her to"
766 "come here where no one seemed to want me, or to care about me, half as"

766 "myself to sleep."
766 ""
766 "I was awoke by somebody saying 'Here he is!' and uncovering my hot head."
766 "My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me, and it was one of them"

766 "'Davy,' said my mother. 'What's the matter?'"

766 "'This is your doing, Peggotty, you cruel thing!' said my mother. 'I have"
766 "no doubt at all about it. How can you reconcile it to your conscience,"
766 "I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is"
766 "dear to me? What do you mean by it, Peggotty?'"
766 ""
766 "Poor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes, and only answered, in a"
766 "sort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner, 'Lord"

766 "Peggotty, you savage creature! Oh, dear me!' cried my mother, turning"
766 "from one of us to the other, in her pettish wilful manner, 'what a"

766 "(a child's Tom Jones, a harmless creature) for a week together. I have"

766 "I sat listening for a long while, but there was not a sound. I crawled"
766 "up from the floor, and saw my face in the glass, so swollen, red, and"
766 "ugly that it almost frightened me. My stripes were sore and stiff, and"
766 "made me cry afresh, when I moved; but they were nothing to the guilt I"
766 "felt. It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious"
766 "criminal, I dare say."
766 ""
766 "It had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the window (I had been lying,"
766 "for the most part, with my head upon the sill, by turns crying, dozing,"
766 "and looking listlessly out), when the key was turned, and Miss Murdstone"
766 "came in with some bread and meat, and milk. These she put down upon the"
766 "table without a word, glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness,"
766 "and then retired, locking the door after her."
766 ""
766 "Long after it was dark I sat there, wondering whether anybody else would"
766 "come. When this appeared improbable for that night, I undressed, and"
766 "went to bed; and, there, I began to wonder fearfully what would be done"
766 "to me. Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed? Whether I"
766 "should be taken into custody, and sent to prison? Whether I was at all"
766 "in danger of being hanged?"
766 ""
766 "I never shall forget the waking, next morning; the being cheerful and"
766 "fresh for the first moment, and then the being weighed down by the stale"
766 "and dismal oppression of remembrance. Miss Murdstone reappeared before"
766 "I was out of bed; told me, in so many words, that I was free to walk in"
766 "the garden for half an hour and no longer; and retired, leaving the door"
766 "open, that I might avail myself of that permission."
766 ""
766 "I did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment, which lasted five"
766 "days. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should have gone down on"
766 "my knees to her and besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one, Miss"
766 "Murdstone excepted, during the whole time--except at evening prayers in"
766 "the parlour; to which I was escorted by Miss Murdstone after everybody"
766 "else was placed; where I was stationed, a young outlaw, all alone by"
766 "myself near the door; and whence I was solemnly conducted by my jailer,"
766 "before any one arose from the devotional posture. I only observed that"
766 "my mother was as far off from me as she could be, and kept her face"
766 "another way so that I never saw it; and that Mr. Murdstone's hand was"
766 "bound up in a large linen wrapper."
766 ""
766 "The length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any one. They"
766 "occupy the place of years in my remembrance. The way in which I listened"
766 "to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible to me;"
766 "the ringing of bells, the opening and shutting of doors, the murmuring"
766 "of voices, the footsteps on the stairs; to any laughing, whistling, or"
766 "singing, outside, which seemed more dismal than anything else to me in"
766 "my solitude and disgrace--the uncertain pace of the hours, especially"
766 "at night, when I would wake thinking it was morning, and find that the"
766 "family were not yet gone to bed, and that all the length of night had"
766 "yet to come--the depressed dreams and nightmares I had--the return of"
766 "day, noon, afternoon, evening, when the boys played in the churchyard,"
766 "and I watched them from a distance within the room, being ashamed to"
766 "show myself at the window lest they should know I was a prisoner--the"
766 "strange sensation of never hearing myself speak--the fleeting intervals"
766 "of something like cheerfulness, which came with eating and drinking,"
766 "and went away with it--the setting in of rain one evening, with a fresh"
766 "smell, and its coming down faster and faster between me and the church,"
766 "until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in gloom, and fear, and"
766 "remorse--all this appears to have gone round and round for years instead"
766 "of days, it is so vividly and strongly stamped on my remembrance. On the"
766 "last night of my restraint, I was awakened by hearing my own name spoken"
766 "in a whisper. I started up in bed, and putting out my arms in the dark,"
766 "said:"
766 ""
766 "'Is that you, Peggotty?'"
766 ""
766 "There was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name again, in a"
766 "tone so very mysterious and awful, that I think I should have gone into"
766 "a fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the"
766 "keyhole."
766 ""
766 "I groped my way to the door, and putting my own lips to the keyhole,"
766 "whispered: 'Is that you, Peggotty dear?'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes, my own precious Davy,' she replied. 'Be as soft as a mouse, or the"
766 "Cat'll hear us.'"
766 ""
766 "I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of the"
766 "urgency of the case; her room being close by."
766 ""
766 "'How's mama, dear Peggotty? Is she very angry with me?'"
766 ""
766 "I could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole, as I was"
766 "doing on mine, before she answered. 'No. Not very.'"
766 ""
766 "'What is going to be done with me, Peggotty dear? Do you know?'"
766 ""
766 "'School. Near London,' was Peggotty's answer. I was obliged to get her"
766 "to repeat it, for she spoke it the first time quite down my throat,"
766 "in consequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the"
766 "keyhole and put my ear there; and though her words tickled me a good"
766 "deal, I didn't hear them."
766 ""
766 "'When, Peggotty?'"
766 ""
766 "'Tomorrow.'"
766 ""
766 "'Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of my"
766 "drawers?' which she had done, though I have forgotten to mention it."
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' said Peggotty. 'Box.'"
766 ""
766 "'Shan't I see mama?'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' said Peggotty. 'Morning.'"
766 ""
766 "Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole, and delivered these"
766 "words through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole"
766 "has ever been the medium of communicating, I will venture to assert:"
766 "shooting in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of"
766 "its own."
766 ""
766 "'Davy, dear. If I ain't been azackly as intimate with you. Lately, as I"
766 "used to be. It ain't because I don't love you. Just as well and more, my"
766 "pretty poppet. It's because I thought it better for you. And for someone"
766 "else besides. Davy, my darling, are you listening? Can you hear?'"
766 ""
766 "'Ye-ye-ye-yes, Peggotty!' I sobbed."
766 ""
766 "'My own!' said Peggotty, with infinite compassion. 'What I want to say,"
766 "is. That you must never forget me. For I'll never forget you. And I'll"
766 "take as much care of your mama, Davy. As ever I took of you. And I won't"
766 "leave her. The day may come when she'll be glad to lay her poor head."
766 "On her stupid, cross old Peggotty's arm again. And I'll write to you,"
766 "my dear. Though I ain't no scholar. And I'll--I'll--' Peggotty fell to"
766 "kissing the keyhole, as she couldn't kiss me."
766 ""
766 "'Thank you, dear Peggotty!' said I. 'Oh, thank you! Thank you! Will you"
766 "promise me one thing, Peggotty? Will you write and tell Mr. Peggotty and"
766 "little Em'ly, and Mrs. Gummidge and Ham, that I am not so bad as they"
766 "might suppose, and that I sent 'em all my love--especially to little"
766 "Em'ly? Will you, if you please, Peggotty?'"
766 ""
766 "The kind soul promised, and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the"
766 "greatest affection--I patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had"
766 "been her honest face--and parted. From that night there grew up in my"
766 "breast a feeling for Peggotty which I cannot very well define. She did"
766 "not replace my mother; no one could do that; but she came into a vacancy"
766 "in my heart, which closed upon her, and I felt towards her something"
766 "I have never felt for any other human being. It was a sort of comical"
766 "affection, too; and yet if she had died, I cannot think what I should"
766 "have done, or how I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been"
766 "to me."
766 ""
766 "In the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual, and told me I was going"
766 "to school; which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed. She"
766 "also informed me that when I was dressed, I was to come downstairs into"
766 "the parlour, and have my breakfast. There, I found my mother, very pale"
766 "and with red eyes: into whose arms I ran, and begged her pardon from my"
766 "suffering soul."
766 ""
766 "'Oh, Davy!' she said. 'That you could hurt anyone I love! Try to be"
766 "better, pray to be better! I forgive you; but I am so grieved, Davy,"
766 "that you should have such bad passions in your heart.'"
766 ""
766 "They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow, and she was more"
766 "sorry for that than for my going away. I felt it sorely. I tried to eat"
766 "my parting breakfast, but my tears dropped upon my bread-and-butter,"
766 "and trickled into my tea. I saw my mother look at me sometimes, and then"
766 "glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone, and than look down, or look away."
766 ""
766 "'Master Copperfield's box there!' said Miss Murdstone, when wheels were"
766 "heard at the gate."
766 ""
766 "I looked for Peggotty, but it was not she; neither she nor Mr. Murdstone"
766 "appeared. My former acquaintance, the carrier, was at the door. The box"
766 "was taken out to his cart, and lifted in."
766 ""
766 "'Clara!' said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note."
766 ""
766 "'Ready, my dear Jane,' returned my mother. 'Good-bye, Davy. You are"
766 "going for your own good. Good-bye, my child. You will come home in the"
766 "holidays, and be a better boy.'"
766 ""
766 "'Clara!' Miss Murdstone repeated."
766 ""
766 "'Certainly, my dear Jane,' replied my mother, who was holding me. 'I"
766 "forgive you, my dear boy. God bless you!'"
766 ""
766 "'Clara!' Miss Murdstone repeated."
766 ""
766 "Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart, and to say on"
766 "the way that she hoped I would repent, before I came to a bad end; and"
766 "then I got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked off with it."

766 "<CHAPTER 5. I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME>"
766 ""
766 ""
766 "We might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was"
766 "quite wet through, when the carrier stopped short. Looking out to"
766 "ascertain for what, I saw, to My amazement, Peggotty burst from a hedge"
766 "and climb into the cart. She took me in both her arms, and squeezed me"
766 "to her stays until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful, though"
766 "I never thought of that till afterwards when I found it very tender. Not"
766 "a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing one of her arms, she put"
766 "it down in her pocket to the elbow, and brought out some paper bags of"
766 "cakes which she crammed into my pockets, and a purse which she put into"
766 "my hand, but not one word did she say. After another and a final squeeze"
766 "with both arms, she got down from the cart and ran away; and, my belief"
766 "is, and has always been, without a solitary button on her gown. I"
766 "picked up one, of several that were rolling about, and treasured it as a"
766 "keepsake for a long time."
766 ""
766 "The carrier looked at me, as if to inquire if she were coming back. I"
766 "shook my head, and said I thought not. 'Then come up,' said the carrier"
766 "to the lazy horse; who came up accordingly."
766 ""
766 "Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began to think"
766 "it was of no use crying any more, especially as neither Roderick Random,"
766 "nor that Captain in the Royal British Navy, had ever cried, that I"
766 "could remember, in trying situations. The carrier, seeing me in this"
766 "resolution, proposed that my pocket-handkerchief should be spread upon"
766 "the horse's back to dry. I thanked him, and assented; and particularly"
766 "small it looked, under those circumstances."
766 ""
766 "I had now leisure to examine the purse. It was a stiff leather purse,"
766 "with a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty had"
766 "evidently polished up with whitening, for my greater delight. But its"
766 "most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit"
766 "of paper, on which was written, in my mother's hand, 'For Davy. With my"
766 "love.' I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrier to be so good"
766 "as to reach me my pocket-handkerchief again; but he said he thought I"
766 "had better do without it, and I thought I really had, so I wiped my eyes"
766 "on my sleeve and stopped myself."
766 ""
766 "For good, too; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was"
766 "still occasionally seized with a stormy sob. After we had jogged on for"
766 "some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going all the way."
766 ""
766 "'All the way where?' inquired the carrier."
766 ""
766 "'There,' I said."
766 ""
766 "'Where's there?' inquired the carrier."
766 ""
766 "'Near London,' I said."
766 ""
766 "'Why that horse,' said the carrier, jerking the rein to point him out,"
766 "'would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground.'"
766 ""
766 "'Are you only going to Yarmouth then?' I asked."
766 ""
766 "'That's about it,' said the carrier. 'And there I shall take you to the"
766 "stage-cutch, and the stage-cutch that'll take you to--wherever it is.'"
766 ""
766 "As this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis)"
766 "to say--he being, as I observed in a former chapter, of a phlegmatic"
766 "temperament, and not at all conversational--I offered him a cake as a"
766 "mark of attention, which he ate at one gulp, exactly like an elephant,"
766 "and which made no more impression on his big face than it would have"
766 "done on an elephant's."
766 ""
766 "'Did SHE make 'em, now?' said Mr. Barkis, always leaning forward, in his"
766 "slouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each knee."
766 ""
766 "'Peggotty, do you mean, sir?'"
766 ""
766 "'Ah!' said Mr. Barkis. 'Her.'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes. She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking.'"
766 ""
766 "'Do she though?' said Mr. Barkis. He made up his mouth as if to whistle,"
766 "but he didn't whistle. He sat looking at the horse's ears, as if he saw"
766 "something new there; and sat so, for a considerable time. By and by, he"
766 "said:"
766 ""
766 "'No sweethearts, I b'lieve?'"
766 ""
766 "'Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis?' For I thought he wanted"
766 "something else to eat, and had pointedly alluded to that description of"
766 "refreshment."
766 ""
766 "'Hearts,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Sweet hearts; no person walks with her!'"
766 ""
766 "'With Peggotty?'"
766 ""
766 "'Ah!' he said. 'Her.'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh, no. She never had a sweetheart.'"
766 ""
766 "'Didn't she, though!' said Mr. Barkis."
766 ""
766 "Again he made up his mouth to whistle, and again he didn't whistle, but"
766 "sat looking at the horse's ears."
766 ""
766 "'So she makes,' said Mr. Barkis, after a long interval of reflection,"
766 "'all the apple parsties, and doos all the cooking, do she?'"
766 ""
766 "I replied that such was the fact."
766 ""
766 "'Well. I'll tell you what,' said Mr. Barkis. 'P'raps you might be"
766 "writin' to her?'"
766 ""
766 "'I shall certainly write to her,' I rejoined."
766 ""
766 "'Ah!' he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. 'Well! If you was"
766 "writin' to her, p'raps you'd recollect to say that Barkis was willin';"
766 "would you?'"
766 ""
766 "'That Barkis is willing,' I repeated, innocently. 'Is that all the"
766 "message?'"
766 ""
766 "'Ye-es,' he said, considering. 'Ye-es. Barkis is willin'.'"
766 ""
766 "'But you will be at Blunderstone again tomorrow, Mr. Barkis,' I said,"
766 "faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then, and"
766 "could give your own message so much better.'"
766 ""
766 "As he repudiated this suggestion, however, with a jerk of his head,"
766 "and once more confirmed his previous request by saying, with profound"
766 "gravity, 'Barkis is willin'. That's the message,' I readily undertook"
766 "its transmission. While I was waiting for the coach in the hotel"
766 "at Yarmouth that very afternoon, I procured a sheet of paper and"
766 "an inkstand, and wrote a note to Peggotty, which ran thus: 'My dear"
766 "Peggotty. I have come here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to mama."
766 "Yours affectionately. P.S. He says he particularly wants you to"
766 "know--BARKIS IS WILLING.'"
766 ""
766 "When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. Barkis"
766 "relapsed into perfect silence; and I, feeling quite worn out by all that"
766 "had happened lately, lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep. I"
766 "slept soundly until we got to Yarmouth; which was so entirely new"
766 "and strange to me in the inn-yard to which we drove, that I at once"
766 "abandoned a latent hope I had had of meeting with some of Mr. Peggotty's"
766 "family there, perhaps even with little Em'ly herself."
766 ""
766 "The coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without any"
766 "horses to it as yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing was"
766 "more unlikely than its ever going to London. I was thinking this, and"
766 "wondering what would ultimately become of my box, which Mr. Barkis had"
766 "put down on the yard-pavement by the pole (he having driven up the yard"
766 "to turn his cart), and also what would ultimately become of me, when a"
766 "lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of meat were"
766 "hanging up, and said:"
766 ""
766 "'Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone?'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes, ma'am,' I said."

766 "'What name?' inquired the lady."

766 "in that name.'"

766 ""
766 "'If you're Master Murdstone,' said the lady, 'why do you go and give"
766 "another name, first?'"
766 ""
766 "I explained to the lady how it was, who than rang a bell, and called"
766 "out, 'William! show the coffee-room!' upon which a waiter came running"
766 "out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it, and seemed"
766 "a good deal surprised when he was only to show it to me."
766 ""
766 "It was a large long room with some large maps in it. I doubt if I could"
766 "have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries, and"
766 "I cast away in the middle of them. I felt it was taking a liberty to"
766 "sit down, with my cap in my hand, on the corner of the chair nearest the"
766 "door; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put a set"
766 "of castors on it, I think I must have turned red all over with modesty."
766 ""
766 "He brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers off in"
766 "such a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some"
766 "offence. But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at"
766 "the table, and saying, very affably, 'Now, six-foot! come on!'"
766 ""
766 "I thanked him, and took my seat at the board; but found it extremely"
766 "difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity,"
766 "or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy, while he was standing"
766 "opposite, staring so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful"
766 "manner every time I caught his eye. After watching me into the second"
766 "chop, he said:"
766 ""
766 "'There's half a pint of ale for you. Will you have it now?'"
766 ""
766 "I thanked him and said, 'Yes.' Upon which he poured it out of a jug"
766 "into a large tumbler, and held it up against the light, and made it look"
766 "beautiful."
766 ""
766 "'My eye!' he said. 'It seems a good deal, don't it?'"
766 ""
766 "'It does seem a good deal,' I answered with a smile. For it was quite"
766 "delightful to me, to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed,"
766 "pimple-faced man, with his hair standing upright all over his head; and"
766 "as he stood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the light with"
766 "the other hand, he looked quite friendly."
766 ""
766 "'There was a gentleman here, yesterday,' he said--'a stout gentleman, by"
766 "the name of Topsawyer--perhaps you know him?'"
766 ""
766 "'No,' I said, 'I don't think--'"
766 ""
766 "'In breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled"
766 "choker,' said the waiter."
766 ""
766 "'No,' I said bashfully, 'I haven't the pleasure--'"
766 ""
766 "'He came in here,' said the waiter, looking at the light through the"
766 "tumbler, 'ordered a glass of this ale--WOULD order it--I told him"
766 "not--drank it, and fell dead. It was too old for him. It oughtn't to be"
766 "drawn; that's the fact.'"
766 ""
766 "I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said I"
766 "thought I had better have some water."

766 "'Why you see,' said the waiter, still looking at the light through the"
766 "tumbler, with one of his eyes shut up, 'our people don't like things"
766 "being ordered and left. It offends 'em. But I'll drink it, if you like."
766 "I'm used to it, and use is everything. I don't think it'll hurt me, if I"
766 "throw my head back, and take it off quick. Shall I?'"
766 ""
766 "I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought"
766 "he could do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he did throw his"
766 "head back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear, I confess,"
766 "of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall"
766 "lifeless on the carpet. But it didn't hurt him. On the contrary, I"
766 "thought he seemed the fresher for it."
766 ""
766 "'What have we got here?' he said, putting a fork into my dish. 'Not"
766 "chops?'"

766 "that his stocking was just breaking out in one place, like a bud."
766 ""
766 "Salem House was a square brick building with wings; of a bare and"
766 "unfurnished appearance. All about it was so very quiet, that I said to"
766 "Mr. Mell I supposed the boys were out; but he seemed surprised at my"
766 "not knowing that it was holiday-time. That all the boys were at their"
766 "several homes. That Mr. Creakle, the proprietor, was down by the"
766 "sea-side with Mrs. and Miss Creakle; and that I was sent in holiday-time"
766 "as a punishment for my misdoing, all of which he explained to me as we"
766 "went along."
766 ""
766 "I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me, as the most forlorn"
766 "and desolate place I had ever seen. I see it now. A long room with three"
766 "long rows of desks, and six of forms, and bristling all round with pegs"
766 "for hats and slates. Scraps of old copy-books and exercises litter the"
766 "dirty floor. Some silkworms' houses, made of the same materials, are"
766 "scattered over the desks. Two miserable little white mice, left behind"
766 "by their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle made of"
766 "pasteboard and wire, looking in all the corners with their red eyes"
766 "for anything to eat. A bird, in a cage very little bigger than himself,"
766 "makes a mournful rattle now and then in hopping on his perch, two inches"
766 "high, or dropping from it; but neither sings nor chirps. There is a"
766 "strange unwholesome smell upon the room, like mildewed corduroys, sweet"
766 "apples wanting air, and rotten books. There could not well be more ink"
766 "splashed about it, if it had been roofless from its first construction,"
766 "and the skies had rained, snowed, hailed, and blown ink through the"
766 "varying seasons of the year."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Mell having left me while he took his irreparable boots upstairs, I"
766 "went softly to the upper end of the room, observing all this as I crept"
766 "along. Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard, beautifully written,"
766 "which was lying on the desk, and bore these words: 'TAKE CARE OF HIM. HE"
766 "BITES.'"
766 ""
766 "I got upon the desk immediately, apprehensive of at least a great dog"
766 "underneath. But, though I looked all round with anxious eyes, I could"
766 "see nothing of him. I was still engaged in peering about, when Mr. Mell"
766 "came back, and asked me what I did up there?"
766 ""
766 "'I beg your pardon, sir,' says I, 'if you please, I'm looking for the"
766 "dog.'"
766 ""
766 "'Dog?' he says. 'What dog?'"
766 ""
766 "'Isn't it a dog, sir?'"
766 ""
766 "'Isn't what a dog?'"
766 ""
766 "'That's to be taken care of, sir; that bites.'"
766 ""
766 "'No, Copperfield,' says he, gravely, 'that's not a dog. That's a boy."
766 "My instructions are, Copperfield, to put this placard on your back. I am"
766 "sorry to make such a beginning with you, but I must do it.' With that he"
766 "took me down, and tied the placard, which was neatly constructed for"
766 "the purpose, on my shoulders like a knapsack; and wherever I went,"
766 "afterwards, I had the consolation of carrying it."
766 ""
766 "What I suffered from that placard, nobody can imagine. Whether it was"
766 "possible for people to see me or not, I always fancied that somebody was"
766 "reading it. It was no relief to turn round and find nobody; for wherever"
766 "my back was, there I imagined somebody always to be. That cruel man with"
766 "the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings. He was in authority; and if he"
766 "ever saw me leaning against a tree, or a wall, or the house, he roared"
766 "out from his lodge door in a stupendous voice, 'Hallo, you sir! You"
766 "Copperfield! Show that badge conspicuous, or I'll report you!' The"
766 "playground was a bare gravelled yard, open to all the back of the house"
766 "and the offices; and I knew that the servants read it, and the butcher"
766 "read it, and the baker read it; that everybody, in a word, who came"
766 "backwards and forwards to the house, of a morning when I was ordered to"
766 "walk there, read that I was to be taken care of, for I bit, I recollect"
766 "that I positively began to have a dread of myself, as a kind of wild boy"
766 "who did bite."
766 ""
766 "There was an old door in this playground, on which the boys had a"
766 "custom of carving their names. It was completely covered with such"
766 "inscriptions. In my dread of the end of the vacation and their coming"
766 "back, I could not read a boy's name, without inquiring in what tone and"
766 "with what emphasis HE would read, 'Take care of him. He bites.' There"
766 "was one boy--a certain J. Steerforth--who cut his name very deep and"
766 "very often, who, I conceived, would read it in a rather strong voice,"
766 "and afterwards pull my hair. There was another boy, one Tommy Traddles,"
766 "who I dreaded would make game of it, and pretend to be dreadfully"
766 "frightened of me. There was a third, George Demple, who I fancied would"
766 "sing it. I have looked, a little shrinking creature, at that door, until"
766 "the owners of all the names--there were five-and-forty of them in the"
766 "school then, Mr. Mell said--seemed to send me to Coventry by general"
766 "acclamation, and to cry out, each in his own way, 'Take care of him. He"
766 "bites!'"

766 "It was the same with the places at the desks and forms. It was the same"
766 "with the groves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at, on my way to, and"
766 "when I was in, my own bed. I remember dreaming night after night, of"
766 "being with my mother as she used to be, or of going to a party at Mr."
766 "Peggotty's, or of travelling outside the stage-coach, or of dining again"
766 "with my unfortunate friend the waiter, and in all these circumstances"
766 "making people scream and stare, by the unhappy disclosure that I had"
766 "nothing on but my little night-shirt, and that placard."
766 ""
766 "In the monotony of my life, and in my constant apprehension of the"
766 "re-opening of the school, it was such an insupportable affliction! I had"
766 "long tasks every day to do with Mr. Mell; but I did them, there being"
766 "no Mr. and Miss Murdstone here, and got through them without disgrace."
766 "Before, and after them, I walked about--supervised, as I have mentioned,"
766 "by the man with the wooden leg. How vividly I call to mind the damp"
766 "about the house, the green cracked flagstones in the court, an old leaky"
766 "water-butt, and the discoloured trunks of some of the grim trees, which"
766 "seemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees, and to have"
766 "blown less in the sun! At one we dined, Mr. Mell and I, at the upper end"
766 "of a long bare dining-room, full of deal tables, and smelling of fat."
766 "Then, we had more tasks until tea, which Mr. Mell drank out of a blue"
766 "teacup, and I out of a tin pot. All day long, and until seven or eight"
766 "in the evening, Mr. Mell, at his own detached desk in the schoolroom,"
766 "worked hard with pen, ink, ruler, books, and writing-paper, making out"
766 "the bills (as I found) for last half-year. When he had put up his things"
766 "for the night he took out his flute, and blew at it, until I almost"
766 "thought he would gradually blow his whole being into the large hole at"
766 "the top, and ooze away at the keys."
766 ""
766 "I picture my small self in the dimly-lighted rooms, sitting with my"
766 "head upon my hand, listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell,"
766 "and conning tomorrow's lessons. I picture myself with my books shut up,"
766 "still listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and listening"
766 "through it to what used to be at home, and to the blowing of the wind"
766 "on Yarmouth flats, and feeling very sad and solitary. I picture myself"
766 "going up to bed, among the unused rooms, and sitting on my bed-side"
766 "crying for a comfortable word from Peggotty. I picture myself coming"
766 "downstairs in the morning, and looking through a long ghastly gash of a"

766 "apprehensions, to the time when the man with the wooden leg shall unlock"
766 "the rusty gate to give admission to the awful Mr. Creakle. I cannot"

766 "all of them I carried the same warning on my back."

766 "seemed to me a bold thing even to take notice that the passage looked"
766 "comfortable, as I went on my way, trembling, to Mr. Creakle's presence:"
766 "which so abashed me, when I was ushered into it, that I hardly saw"
766 "Mrs. Creakle or Miss Creakle (who were both there, in the parlour), or"

766 "the two sides interlaced on his forehead. But the circumstance about"
766 "him which impressed me most, was, that he had no voice, but spoke in a"

766 "boy being J. Steerforth. Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was"
766 "stated, and said that he should like to begin to see him do it. On being"
766 "asked by a mild boy (not me) how he would proceed if he did begin to see"
766 "him do it, he dipped a match into his phosphorus-box on purpose to shed"
766 "a glare over his reply, and said he would commence by knocking him down"

766 "which was again corroborated by J. Steerforth, the only parlour-boarder."
766 "I heard that Mr. Sharp's wig didn't fit him; and that he needn't be so"
766 "'bounceable'--somebody else said 'bumptious'--about it, because his own"
766 "red hair was very plainly to be seen behind."

766 "I heard that one boy, who was a coal-merchant's son, came as a set-off"
766 "against the coal-bill, and was called, on that account, 'Exchange or"
766 "Barter'--a name selected from the arithmetic book as expressing this"
766 "arrangement. I heard that the table beer was a robbery of parents, and"
766 "the pudding an imposition. I heard that Miss Creakle was regarded by the"
766 "school in general as being in love with Steerforth; and I am sure, as I"
766 "sat in the dark, thinking of his nice voice, and his fine face, and his"
766 "easy manner, and his curling hair, I thought it very likely. I heard"
766 "that Mr. Mell was not a bad sort of fellow, but hadn't a sixpence to"
766 "bless himself with; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell, his"
766 "mother, was as poor as job. I thought of my breakfast then, and what had"

766 "upon me, I remember, by the roar of voices in the schoolroom suddenly"
766 "becoming hushed as death when Mr. Creakle entered after breakfast, and"
766 "stood in the doorway looking round upon us like a giant in a story-book"
766 "surveying his captives."

766 "Tungay stood at Mr. Creakle's elbow. He had no occasion, I thought,"

766 "'Now, boys, this is a new half. Take care what you're about, in this new"
766 "half. Come fresh up to the lessons, I advise you, for I come fresh up"

766 "When this dreadful exordium was over, and Tungay had stumped out again,"
766 "Mr. Creakle came to where I sat, and told me that if I were famous for"
766 "biting, he was famous for biting, too. He then showed me the cane, and"
766 "asked me what I thought of THAT, for a tooth? Was it a sharp tooth, hey?"
766 "Was it a double tooth, hey? Had it a deep prong, hey? Did it bite, hey?"
766 "Did it bite? At every question he gave me a fleshy cut with it that made"
766 "me writhe; so I was very soon made free of Salem House (as Steerforth"
766 "said), and was very soon in tears also."
766 ""
766 "Not that I mean to say these were special marks of distinction,"
766 "which only I received. On the contrary, a large majority of the boys"
766 "(especially the smaller ones) were visited with similar instances"
766 "of notice, as Mr. Creakle made the round of the schoolroom. Half the"
766 "establishment was writhing and crying, before the day's work began; and"
766 "how much of it had writhed and cried before the day's work was over, I"
766 "am really afraid to recollect, lest I should seem to exaggerate."
766 ""
766 "I should think there never can have been a man who enjoyed his"
766 "profession more than Mr. Creakle did. He had a delight in cutting at"
766 "the boys, which was like the satisfaction of a craving appetite. I am"
766 "confident that he couldn't resist a chubby boy, especially; that there"
766 "was a fascination in such a subject, which made him restless in his"
766 "mind, until he had scored and marked him for the day. I was chubby"
766 "myself, and ought to know. I am sure when I think of the fellow now, my"
766 "blood rises against him with the disinterested indignation I should"
766 "feel if I could have known all about him without having ever been in his"
766 "power; but it rises hotly, because I know him to have been an incapable"
766 "brute, who had no more right to be possessed of the great trust he held,"
766 "than to be Lord High Admiral, or Commander-in-Chief--in either of"
766 "which capacities it is probable that he would have done infinitely less"
766 "mischief."

766 "sting out with a pocket-handkerchief. I have plenty to do. I don't watch"

766 "though he pretends he don't. He makes dreadful mouths as he rules the"
766 "ciphering-book; and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane, and we"
766 "all droop over our books and tremble. A moment afterwards we are again"
766 "eyeing him. An unhappy culprit, found guilty of imperfect exercise,"
766 "approaches at his command. The culprit falters excuses, and professes a"
766 "determination to do better tomorrow. Mr. Creakle cuts a joke before he"

766 ""
766 "Here I sit at the desk again, on a drowsy summer afternoon. A buzz and"

766 "sensation of the lukewarm fat of meat is upon me (we dined an hour or"
766 "two ago), and my head is as heavy as so much lead. I would give the"
766 "world to go to sleep. I sit with my eye on Mr. Creakle, blinking at him"
766 "like a young owl; when sleep overpowers me for a minute, he still looms"

766 "his face near it, mine assumes an imploring and submissive expression."

766 "stops in the middle of a shout or yell, and becomes contemplative. One"
766 "day, Traddles (the most unfortunate boy in the world) breaks that window"
766 "accidentally, with a ball. I shudder at this moment with the tremendous"

766 "Mr. Creakle's sacred head."
766 ""
766 "Poor Traddles! In a tight sky-blue suit that made his arms and legs like"

766 "miserable of all the boys. He was always being caned--I think he was"
766 "caned every day that half-year, except one holiday Monday when he was"
766 "only ruler'd on both hands--and was always going to write to his uncle"
766 "about it, and never did. After laying his head on the desk for a little"
766 "while, he would cheer up, somehow, begin to laugh again, and draw"
766 "skeletons all over his slate, before his eyes were dry. I used at first"
766 "to wonder what comfort Traddles found in drawing skeletons; and for some"
766 "time looked upon him as a sort of hermit, who reminded himself by those"
766 "symbols of mortality that caning couldn't last for ever. But I believe"
766 "he only did it because they were easy, and didn't want any features."
766 ""
766 "He was very honourable, Traddles was, and held it as a solemn duty"
766 "in the boys to stand by one another. He suffered for this on several"
766 "occasions; and particularly once, when Steerforth laughed in church,"
766 "and the Beadle thought it was Traddles, and took him out. I see him now,"
766 "going away in custody, despised by the congregation. He never said"
766 "who was the real offender, though he smarted for it next day, and was"
766 "imprisoned so many hours that he came forth with a whole churchyard-full"
766 "of skeletons swarming all over his Latin Dictionary. But he had his"
766 "reward. Steerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in Traddles, and"
766 "we all felt that to be the highest praise. For my part, I could have"
766 "gone through a good deal (though I was much less brave than Traddles,"
766 "and nothing like so old) to have won such a recompense."
766 ""
766 "To see Steerforth walk to church before us, arm-in-arm with Miss"
766 "Creakle, was one of the great sights of my life. I didn't think Miss"
766 "Creakle equal to little Em'ly in point of beauty, and I didn't love"
766 "her (I didn't dare); but I thought her a young lady of extraordinary"
766 "attractions, and in point of gentility not to be surpassed. When"
766 "Steerforth, in white trousers, carried her parasol for her, I felt proud"
766 "to know him; and believed that she could not choose but adore him with"
766 "all her heart. Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell were both notable personages in my"
766 "eyes; but Steerforth was to them what the sun was to two stars."
766 ""
766 "Steerforth continued his protection of me, and proved a very useful"

766 "Creakle, who was very severe with me; but whenever I had been treated"
766 "worse than usual, he always told me that I wanted a little of his pluck,"

766 "I had a profound faith in them, and I had, to the best of my belief,"
766 "a simple, earnest manner of narrating what I did narrate; and these"
766 "qualities went a long way."
766 ""
766 "The drawback was, that I was often sleepy at night, or out of spirits"
766 "and indisposed to resume the story; and then it was rather hard work,"
766 "and it must be done; for to disappoint or to displease Steerforth was of"
766 "course out of the question. In the morning, too, when I felt weary, and"
766 "should have enjoyed another hour's repose very much, it was a tiresome"
766 "thing to be roused, like the Sultana Scheherazade, and forced into a"
766 "long story before the getting-up bell rang; but Steerforth was resolute;"
766 "and as he explained to me, in return, my sums and exercises, and"
766 "anything in my tasks that was too hard for me, I was no loser by the"
766 "transaction. Let me do myself justice, however. I was moved by no"
766 "interested or selfish motive, nor was I moved by fear of him. I admired"
766 "and loved him, and his approval was return enough. It was so precious to"
766 "me that I look back on these trifles, now, with an aching heart."
766 ""
766 "Steerforth was considerate, too; and showed his consideration, in"
766 "one particular instance, in an unflinching manner that was a little"
766 "tantalizing, I suspect, to poor Traddles and the rest. Peggotty's"
766 "promised letter--what a comfortable letter it was!--arrived before"

766 "was his exact expression--and it should be, every drop, devoted to the"
766 "purpose he had mentioned. Accordingly, it was locked up in his box, and"
766 "drawn off by himself in a phial, and administered to me through a"
766 "piece of quill in the cork, when I was supposed to be in want of a"
766 "restorative. Sometimes, to make it a more sovereign specific, he was so"
766 "kind as to squeeze orange juice into it, or to stir it up with ginger,"
766 "or dissolve a peppermint drop in it; and although I cannot assert that"
766 "the flavour was improved by these experiments, or that it was exactly"

766 "laugh, and with tears in my eyes--was a sort of chorus, in general;"
766 "and affected to be convulsed with mirth at the comic parts, and to be"
766 "overcome with fear when there was any passage of an alarming character"
766 "in the narrative. This rather put me out, very often. It was a great"
766 "jest of his, I recollect, to pretend that he couldn't keep his teeth"
766 "from chattering, whenever mention was made of an Alguazill in connexion"
766 "with the adventures of Gil Blas; and I remember that when Gil Blas met"
766 "the captain of the robbers in Madrid, this unlucky joker counterfeited"
766 "such an ague of terror, that he was overheard by Mr. Creakle, who"
766 "was prowling about the passage, and handsomely flogged for disorderly"
766 "conduct in the bedroom. Whatever I had within me that was romantic and"
766 "dreamy, was encouraged by so much story-telling in the dark; and in that"
766 "respect the pursuit may not have been very profitable to me. But the"
766 "being cherished as a kind of plaything in my room, and the consciousness"
766 "that this accomplishment of mine was bruited about among the boys, and"
766 "attracted a good deal of notice to me though I was the youngest there,"
766 "stimulated me to exertion. In a school carried on by sheer cruelty,"
766 "whether it is presided over by a dunce or not, there is not likely to"
766 "be much learnt. I believe our boys were, generally, as ignorant a set"
766 "as any schoolboys in existence; they were too much troubled and knocked"
766 "about to learn; they could no more do that to advantage, than any one"
766 "can do anything to advantage in a life of constant misfortune, torment,"
766 "and worry. But my little vanity, and Steerforth's help, urged me on"
766 "somehow; and without saving me from much, if anything, in the way of"
766 "punishment, made me, for the time I was there, an exception to the"
766 "general body, insomuch that I did steadily pick up some crumbs of"
766 "knowledge."

766 "Mr. Creakle then made a speech, through Tungay, in which he thanked"
766 "Steerforth for asserting (though perhaps too warmly) the independence"
766 "and respectability of Salem House; and which he wound up by shaking"
766 "hands with Steerforth, while we gave three cheers--I did not quite know"
766 "what for, but I supposed for Steerforth, and so joined in them ardently,"

766 "being discovered in tears, instead of cheers, on account of Mr. Mell's"
766 "departure; and went back to his sofa, or his bed, or wherever he had"
766 "come from."

766 "back my tears but the fear that Steerforth, who often looked at me, I"
766 "saw, might think it unfriendly--or, I should rather say, considering our"
766 "relative ages, and the feeling with which I regarded him, undutiful--if"
766 "I showed the emotion which distressed me. He was very angry with"

766 ""
766 "Poor Traddles, who had passed the stage of lying with his head upon the"

766 ""
766 "'His feelings?' repeated Steerforth disdainfully. 'His feelings will"
766 "soon get the better of it, I'll be bound. His feelings are not like"

766 ""
766 "We thought this intention very noble in Steerforth, whose mother was"
766 "a widow, and rich, and would do almost anything, it was said, that he"

766 "and exalted Steerforth to the skies: especially when he told us, as he"
766 "condescended to do, that what he had done had been done expressly for"
766 "us, and for our cause; and that he had conferred a great boon upon us"
766 "by unselfishly doing it. But I must say that when I was going on with a"
766 "story in the dark that night, Mr. Mell's old flute seemed more than once"
766 "to sound mournfully in my ears; and that when at last Steerforth was"
766 "tired, and I lay down in my bed, I fancied it playing so sorrowfully"
766 "somewhere, that I was quite wretched."

766 "I soon forgot him in the contemplation of Steerforth, who, in an easy"
766 "amateur way, and without any book (he seemed to me to know everything by"

766 "master came from a grammar school; and before he entered on his duties,"
766 "dined in the parlour one day, to be introduced to Steerforth. Steerforth"
766 "approved of him highly, and told us he was a Brick. Without exactly"
766 "understanding what learned distinction was meant by this, I respected"

766 "at me with their hats, and squeezing one another against the wall. I"
766 "could not help laughing; but it was much more in the pleasure of seeing"
766 "them, than at the appearance they made. We shook hands in a very"

766 "character of this conversation at the time; but I am sure, now, that"
766 "the good creature originated it, and took her part in it, merely that"
766 "my mother might comfort herself with the little contradictory summary in"
766 "which she had indulged. The design was efficacious; for I remember that"
766 "my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the evening, and that"
766 "Peggotty observed her less."
766 ""
766 "When we had had our tea, and the ashes were thrown up, and the candles"
766 "snuffed, I read Peggotty a chapter out of the Crocodile Book, in"
766 "remembrance of old times--she took it out of her pocket: I don't know"
766 "whether she had kept it there ever since--and then we talked about Salem"
766 "House, which brought me round again to Steerforth, who was my great"
766 "subject. We were very happy; and that evening, as the last of its race,"
766 "and destined evermore to close that volume of my life, will never pass"
766 "out of my memory."
766 ""
766 "It was almost ten o'clock before we heard the sound of wheels. We all"
766 "got up then; and my mother said hurriedly that, as it was so late, and"
766 "Mr. and Miss Murdstone approved of early hours for young people, perhaps"
766 "I had better go to bed. I kissed her, and went upstairs with my candle"
766 "directly, before they came in. It appeared to my childish fancy, as I"
766 "ascended to the bedroom where I had been imprisoned, that they brought"
766 "a cold blast of air into the house which blew away the old familiar"
766 "feeling like a feather."
766 ""
766 "I felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast in the morning, as"
766 "I had never set eyes on Mr. Murdstone since the day when I committed my"
766 "memorable offence. However, as it must be done, I went down, after two"
766 "or three false starts half-way, and as many runs back on tiptoe to my"
766 "own room, and presented myself in the parlour."
766 ""
766 "He was standing before the fire with his back to it, while Miss"
766 "Murdstone made the tea. He looked at me steadily as I entered, but made"
766 "no sign of recognition whatever. I went up to him, after a moment of"
766 "confusion, and said: 'I beg your pardon, sir. I am very sorry for what I"
766 "did, and I hope you will forgive me.'"
766 ""
766 "'I am glad to hear you are sorry, David,' he replied."
766 ""
766 "The hand he gave me was the hand I had bitten. I could not restrain my"
766 "eye from resting for an instant on a red spot upon it; but it was not so"
766 "red as I turned, when I met that sinister expression in his face."
766 ""
766 "'How do you do, ma'am?' I said to Miss Murdstone."
766 ""
766 "'Ah, dear me!' sighed Miss Murdstone, giving me the tea-caddy scoop"
766 "instead of her fingers. 'How long are the holidays?'"
766 ""
766 "'A month, ma'am.'"
766 ""
766 "'Counting from when?'"
766 ""
766 "'From today, ma'am.'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh!' said Miss Murdstone. 'Then here's one day off.'"
766 ""
766 "She kept a calendar of the holidays in this way, and every morning"
766 "checked a day off in exactly the same manner. She did it gloomily until"
766 "she came to ten, but when she got into two figures she became more"
766 "hopeful, and, as the time advanced, even jocular."
766 ""
766 "It was on this very first day that I had the misfortune to throw her,"
766 "though she was not subject to such weakness in general, into a state of"
766 "violent consternation. I came into the room where she and my mother"
766 "were sitting; and the baby (who was only a few weeks old) being on"
766 "my mother's lap, I took it very carefully in my arms. Suddenly Miss"
766 "Murdstone gave such a scream that I all but dropped it."
766 ""
766 "'My dear Jane!' cried my mother."
766 ""
766 "'Good heavens, Clara, do you see?' exclaimed Miss Murdstone."
766 ""
766 "'See what, my dear Jane?' said my mother; 'where?'"
766 ""
766 "'He's got it!' cried Miss Murdstone. 'The boy has got the baby!'"
766 ""
766 "She was limp with horror; but stiffened herself to make a dart at me,"
766 "and take it out of my arms. Then, she turned faint; and was so very"
766 "ill that they were obliged to give her cherry brandy. I was solemnly"
766 "interdicted by her, on her recovery, from touching my brother any more"
766 "on any pretence whatever; and my poor mother, who, I could see, wished"
766 "otherwise, meekly confirmed the interdict, by saying: 'No doubt you are"
766 "right, my dear Jane.'"
766 ""
766 "On another occasion, when we three were together, this same dear"
766 "baby--it was truly dear to me, for our mother's sake--was the innocent"
766 "occasion of Miss Murdstone's going into a passion. My mother, who had"
766 "been looking at its eyes as it lay upon her lap, said:"
766 ""
766 "'Davy! come here!' and looked at mine."
766 ""
766 "I saw Miss Murdstone lay her beads down."
766 ""
766 "'I declare,' said my mother, gently, 'they are exactly alike. I suppose"
766 "they are mine. I think they are the colour of mine. But they are"
766 "wonderfully alike.'"
766 ""
766 "'What are you talking about, Clara?' said Miss Murdstone."
766 ""
766 "'My dear Jane,' faltered my mother, a little abashed by the harsh tone"
766 "of this inquiry, 'I find that the baby's eyes and Davy's are exactly"
766 "alike.'"
766 ""
766 "'Clara!' said Miss Murdstone, rising angrily, 'you are a positive fool"
766 "sometimes.'"
766 ""
766 "'My dear Jane,' remonstrated my mother."
766 ""
766 "'A positive fool,' said Miss Murdstone. 'Who else could compare my"
766 "brother's baby with your boy? They are not at all alike. They are"
766 "exactly unlike. They are utterly dissimilar in all respects. I hope"
766 "they will ever remain so. I will not sit here, and hear such comparisons"
766 "made.' With that she stalked out, and made the door bang after her."
766 ""
766 "In short, I was not a favourite with Miss Murdstone. In short, I was not"
766 "a favourite there with anybody, not even with myself; for those who did"
766 "like me could not show it, and those who did not, showed it so plainly"
766 "that I had a sensitive consciousness of always appearing constrained,"
766 "boorish, and dull."
766 ""
766 "I felt that I made them as uncomfortable as they made me. If I came into"
766 "the room where they were, and they were talking together and my mother"
766 "seemed cheerful, an anxious cloud would steal over her face from the"
766 "moment of my entrance. If Mr. Murdstone were in his best humour, I"
766 "checked him. If Miss Murdstone were in her worst, I intensified it. I"
766 "had perception enough to know that my mother was the victim always; that"
766 "she was afraid to speak to me or to be kind to me, lest she should"
766 "give them some offence by her manner of doing so, and receive a"
766 "lecture afterwards; that she was not only ceaselessly afraid of her own"
766 "offending, but of my offending, and uneasily watched their looks if I"
766 "only moved. Therefore I resolved to keep myself as much out of their way"
766 "as I could; and many a wintry hour did I hear the church clock strike,"
766 "when I was sitting in my cheerless bedroom, wrapped in my little"
766 "great-coat, poring over a book."
766 ""
766 "In the evening, sometimes, I went and sat with Peggotty in the kitchen."
766 "There I was comfortable, and not afraid of being myself. But neither of"
766 "these resources was approved of in the parlour. The tormenting humour"
766 "which was dominant there stopped them both. I was still held to be"
766 "necessary to my poor mother's training, and, as one of her trials, could"
766 "not be suffered to absent myself."
766 ""
766 "'David,' said Mr. Murdstone, one day after dinner when I was going to"
766 "leave the room as usual; 'I am sorry to observe that you are of a sullen"
766 "disposition.'"

766 "'No doubt, my dear Jane,' returned my mother, 'your understanding is"
766 "very vigorous--'"

766 "angrily."
766 ""
766 "'But I am sure it is,' resumed my mother; 'and everybody knows it is. I"
766 "profit so much by it myself, in many ways--at least I ought to--that no"
766 "one can be more convinced of it than myself; and therefore I speak with"
766 "great diffidence, my dear Jane, I assure you.'"
766 ""
766 "'We'll say I don't understand the boy, Clara,' returned Miss Murdstone,"
766 "arranging the little fetters on her wrists. 'We'll agree, if you please,"
766 "that I don't understand him at all. He is much too deep for me. But"
766 "perhaps my brother's penetration may enable him to have some insight"
766 "into his character. And I believe my brother was speaking on the subject"
766 "when we--not very decently--interrupted him.'"

766 "'I think, Clara,' said Mr. Murdstone, in a low grave voice, 'that there"

766 "you.'"

766 "and his eyes stiffly towards me, 'to observe that you are of a sullen"

766 "improvement. Of the woman who abets you, I say nothing--since you,"

766 "complain (as she did on the least pretence) of my restlessness, and"
766 "afraid to move an eye lest she should light on some look of dislike"

766 "watching Miss Murdstone's little shiny steel beads as she strung them;"
766 "and wondering whether she would ever be married, and if so, to what"

766 "no possibility of breaking in, a weight that brooded on my wits, and"
766 "blunted them!"
766 ""
766 "What meals I had in silence and embarrassment, always feeling that there"
766 "were a knife and fork too many, and that mine; an appetite too many, and"

766 "many, and that I!"
766 ""
766 "What evenings, when the candles came, and I was expected to employ"
766 "myself, but, not daring to read an entertaining book, pored over some"
766 "hard-headed, harder-hearted treatise on arithmetic; when the tables of"
766 "weights and measures set themselves to tunes, as 'Rule Britannia', or"
766 "'Away with Melancholy'; when they wouldn't stand still to be learnt, but"
766 "would go threading my grandmother's needle through my unfortunate head,"
766 "in at one ear and out at the other! What yawns and dozes I lapsed into,"
766 "in spite of all my care; what starts I came out of concealed sleeps"
766 "with; what answers I never got, to little observations that I rarely"
766 "made; what a blank space I seemed, which everybody overlooked, and"

766 ""
766 "The three young women, who appeared to be very industrious and"
766 "comfortable, raised their heads to look at me, and then went on with"
766 "their work. Stitch, stitch, stitch. At the same time there came from"
766 "a workshop across a little yard outside the window, a regular sound"
766 "of hammering that kept a kind of tune: RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat,"
766 "RAT--tat-tat, without any variation."
766 ""
766 "'Well,' said my conductor to one of the three young women. 'How do you"
766 "get on, Minnie?'"
766 ""
766 "'We shall be ready by the trying-on time,' she replied gaily, without"
766 "looking up. 'Don't you be afraid, father.'"

766 "Mr. Omer took off his broad-brimmed hat, and sat down and panted. He was"
766 "so fat that he was obliged to pant some time before he could say:"
766 ""

766 ""
766 "'Father!' said Minnie, playfully. 'What a porpoise you do grow!'"

766 ""
766 "'I hope so, my dear,' said Mr. Omer. 'As I have got my breath now, I"
766 "think I'll measure this young scholar. Would you walk into the shop,"
766 "Master Copperfield?'"
766 ""
766 "I preceded Mr. Omer, in compliance with his request; and after showing"
766 "me a roll of cloth which he said was extra super, and too good mourning"
766 "for anything short of parents, he took my various dimensions, and put"
766 "them down in a book. While he was recording them he called my attention"
766 "to his stock in trade, and to certain fashions which he said had 'just"
766 "come up', and to certain other fashions which he said had 'just gone"
766 "out'."
766 ""
766 "'And by that sort of thing we very often lose a little mint of money,'"
766 "said Mr. Omer. 'But fashions are like human beings. They come in, nobody"
766 "knows when, why, or how; and they go out, nobody knows when, why, or"
766 "how. Everything is like life, in my opinion, if you look at it in that"
766 "point of view.'"
766 ""
766 "I was too sorrowful to discuss the question, which would possibly have"
766 "been beyond me under any circumstances; and Mr. Omer took me back into"
766 "the parlour, breathing with some difficulty on the way."

766 "He then called down a little break-neck range of steps behind a door:"
766 "'Bring up that tea and bread-and-butter!' which, after some time,"
766 "during which I sat looking about me and thinking, and listening to the"
766 "stitching in the room and the tune that was being hammered across the"
766 "yard, appeared on a tray, and turned out to be for me."
766 ""
766 "'I have been acquainted with you,' said Mr. Omer, after watching me"
766 "for some minutes, during which I had not made much impression on the"
766 "breakfast, for the black things destroyed my appetite, 'I have been"
766 "acquainted with you a long time, my young friend.'"
766 ""
766 "'Have you, sir?'"
766 ""
766 "'All your life,' said Mr. Omer. 'I may say before it. I knew your"

766 "five-and-twen-ty foot of ground.'"
766 ""
766 "'RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat,' across the yard."
766 ""
766 "'He lays in five and twen-ty foot of ground, if he lays in a fraction,'"
766 "said Mr. Omer, pleasantly. 'It was either his request or her direction,"
766 "I forget which.'"
766 ""
766 "'Do you know how my little brother is, sir?' I inquired."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Omer shook his head."
766 ""
766 "'RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat.'"

766 "'Don't mind it more than you can help,' said Mr. Omer. 'Yes. The baby's"
766 "dead.'"
766 ""
766 "My wounds broke out afresh at this intelligence. I left the"
766 "scarcely-tasted breakfast, and went and rested my head on another table,"
766 "in a corner of the little room, which Minnie hastily cleared, lest I"
766 "should spot the mourning that was lying there with my tears. She was"
766 "a pretty, good-natured girl, and put my hair away from my eyes with a"
766 "soft, kind touch; but she was very cheerful at having nearly finished"
766 "her work and being in good time, and was so different from me!"
766 ""
766 "Presently the tune left off, and a good-looking young fellow came across"
766 "the yard into the room. He had a hammer in his hand, and his mouth was"
766 "full of little nails, which he was obliged to take out before he could"
766 "speak."
766 ""
766 "'Well, Joram!' said Mr. Omer. 'How do you get on?'"
766 ""
766 "'All right,' said Joram. 'Done, sir.'"

766 "Minnie coloured a little, and the other two girls smiled at one another."
766 ""
766 "'What! you were at it by candle-light last night, when I was at the"
766 "club, then? Were you?' said Mr. Omer, shutting up one eye."
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' said Joram. 'As you said we could make a little trip of it, and"
766 "go over together, if it was done, Minnie and me--and you.'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh! I thought you were going to leave me out altogether,' said Mr."
766 "Omer, laughing till he coughed."
766 ""
766 "'--As you was so good as to say that,' resumed the young man, 'why I"
766 "turned to with a will, you see. Will you give me your opinion of it?'"
766 ""
766 "'I will,' said Mr. Omer, rising. 'My dear'; and he stopped and turned to"
766 "me: 'would you like to see your--'"
766 ""
766 "'No, father,' Minnie interposed."
766 ""
766 "'I thought it might be agreeable, my dear,' said Mr. Omer. 'But perhaps"
766 "you're right.'"
766 ""
766 "I can't say how I knew it was my dear, dear mother's coffin that they"
766 "went to look at. I had never heard one making; I had never seen one that"
766 "I know of.--but it came into my mind what the noise was, while it was"
766 "going on; and when the young man entered, I am sure I knew what he had"
766 "been doing."
766 ""
766 "The work being now finished, the two girls, whose names I had not heard,"
766 "brushed the shreds and threads from their dresses, and went into the"
766 "shop to put that to rights, and wait for customers. Minnie stayed behind"
766 "to fold up what they had made, and pack it in two baskets. This she did"
766 "upon her knees, humming a lively little tune the while. Joram, who I had"
766 "no doubt was her lover, came in and stole a kiss from her while she was"
766 "busy (he didn't appear to mind me, at all), and said her father was gone"
766 "for the chaise, and he must make haste and get himself ready. Then he"
766 "went out again; and then she put her thimble and scissors in her pocket,"
766 "and stuck a needle threaded with black thread neatly in the bosom of her"
766 "gown, and put on her outer clothing smartly, at a little glass behind"
766 "the door, in which I saw the reflection of her pleased face."
766 ""
766 "All this I observed, sitting at the table in the corner with my head"
766 "leaning on my hand, and my thoughts running on very different things."
766 "The chaise soon came round to the front of the shop, and the baskets"
766 "being put in first, I was put in next, and those three followed. I"
766 "remember it as a kind of half chaise-cart, half pianoforte-van, painted"
766 "of a sombre colour, and drawn by a black horse with a long tail. There"
766 "was plenty of room for us all."
766 ""
766 "I do not think I have ever experienced so strange a feeling in my life"
766 "(I am wiser now, perhaps) as that of being with them, remembering how"
766 "they had been employed, and seeing them enjoy the ride. I was not angry"
766 "with them; I was more afraid of them, as if I were cast away among"
766 "creatures with whom I had no community of nature. They were very"
766 "cheerful. The old man sat in front to drive, and the two young people"
766 "sat behind him, and whenever he spoke to them leaned forward, the one on"
766 "one side of his chubby face and the other on the other, and made a great"
766 "deal of him. They would have talked to me too, but I held back, and"
766 "moped in my corner; scared by their love-making and hilarity, though"
766 "it was far from boisterous, and almost wondering that no judgement came"
766 "upon them for their hardness of heart."
766 ""
766 "So, when they stopped to bait the horse, and ate and drank and enjoyed"
766 "themselves, I could touch nothing that they touched, but kept my fast"
766 "unbroken. So, when we reached home, I dropped out of the chaise behind,"
766 "as quickly as possible, that I might not be in their company before"
766 "those solemn windows, looking blindly on me like closed eyes once"
766 "bright. And oh, how little need I had had to think what would move me to"
766 "tears when I came back--seeing the window of my mother's room, and next"
766 "it that which, in the better time, was mine!"
766 ""
766 "I was in Peggotty's arms before I got to the door, and she took me into"
766 "the house. Her grief burst out when she first saw me; but she controlled"
766 "it soon, and spoke in whispers, and walked softly, as if the dead could"
766 "be disturbed. She had not been in bed, I found, for a long time. She"
766 "sat up at night still, and watched. As long as her poor dear pretty was"
766 "above the ground, she said, she would never desert her."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Murdstone took no heed of me when I went into the parlour where he"
766 "was, but sat by the fireside, weeping silently, and pondering in his"
766 "elbow-chair. Miss Murdstone, who was busy at her writing-desk, which"
766 "was covered with letters and papers, gave me her cold finger-nails, and"
766 "asked me, in an iron whisper, if I had been measured for my mourning."
766 ""
766 "I said: 'Yes.'"
766 ""
766 "'And your shirts,' said Miss Murdstone; 'have you brought 'em home?'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes, ma'am. I have brought home all my clothes.'"
766 ""
766 "This was all the consolation that her firmness administered to me. I do"
766 "not doubt that she had a choice pleasure in exhibiting what she called"
766 "her self-command, and her firmness, and her strength of mind, and"
766 "her common sense, and the whole diabolical catalogue of her unamiable"
766 "qualities, on such an occasion. She was particularly proud of her turn"
766 "for business; and she showed it now in reducing everything to pen and"
766 "ink, and being moved by nothing. All the rest of that day, and from"
766 "morning to night afterwards, she sat at that desk, scratching composedly"
766 "with a hard pen, speaking in the same imperturbable whisper to"
766 "everybody; never relaxing a muscle of her face, or softening a tone of"
766 "her voice, or appearing with an atom of her dress astray."

766 "Her brother took a book sometimes, but never read it that I saw. He"
766 "would open it and look at it as if he were reading, but would remain for"
766 "a whole hour without turning the leaf, and then put it down and walk to"
766 "and fro in the room. I used to sit with folded hands watching him, and"
766 "counting his footsteps, hour after hour. He very seldom spoke to her,"

766 "night, and sat by my bed's head while I went to sleep. A day or"
766 "two before the burial--I think it was a day or two before, but I am"
766 "conscious of confusion in my mind about that heavy time, with nothing"
766 "to mark its progress--she took me into the room. I only recollect that"
766 "underneath some white covering on the bed, with a beautiful cleanliness"
766 "and freshness all around it, there seemed to me to lie embodied the"
766 "solemn stillness that was in the house; and that when she would have"

766 "patterns of the glasses and plates, the faint sweet smell of cake, the"

766 "in the room, and comes to speak to me."

766 "There was one change in my condition, which, while it relieved me of"
766 "a great deal of present uneasiness, might have made me, if I had been"
766 "capable of considering it closely, yet more uncomfortable about the"
766 "future. It was this. The constraint that had been put upon me, was quite"
766 "abandoned. I was so far from being required to keep my dull post in"
766 "the parlour, that on several occasions, when I took my seat there, Miss"
766 "Murdstone frowned to me to go away. I was so far from being warned off"
766 "from Peggotty's society, that, provided I was not in Mr. Murdstone's, I"
766 "was never sought out or inquired for. At first I was in daily dread of"
766 "his taking my education in hand again, or of Miss Murdstone's"
766 "devoting herself to it; but I soon began to think that such fears were"
766 "groundless, and that all I had to anticipate was neglect."
766 ""
766 "I do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then. I was"
766 "still giddy with the shock of my mother's death, and in a kind of"
766 "stunned state as to all tributary things. I can recollect, indeed, to"
766 "have speculated, at odd times, on the possibility of my not being taught"
766 "any more, or cared for any more; and growing up to be a shabby, moody"
766 "man, lounging an idle life away, about the village; as well as on the"
766 "feasibility of my getting rid of this picture by going away somewhere,"
766 "like the hero in a story, to seek my fortune: but these were transient"
766 "visions, daydreams I sat looking at sometimes, as if they were faintly"
766 "painted or written on the wall of my room, and which, as they melted"
766 "away, left the wall blank again."
766 ""
766 "'Peggotty,' I said in a thoughtful whisper, one evening, when I was"
766 "warming my hands at the kitchen fire, 'Mr. Murdstone likes me less than"
766 "he used to. He never liked me much, Peggotty; but he would rather not"
766 "even see me now, if he can help it.'"
766 ""
766 "'Perhaps it's his sorrow,' said Peggotty, stroking my hair."
766 ""
766 "'I am sure, Peggotty, I am sorry too. If I believed it was his sorrow,"
766 "I should not think of it at all. But it's not that; oh, no, it's not"
766 "that.'"
766 ""
766 "'How do you know it's not that?' said Peggotty, after a silence."
766 ""
766 "'Oh, his sorrow is another and quite a different thing. He is sorry at"
766 "this moment, sitting by the fireside with Miss Murdstone; but if I was"
766 "to go in, Peggotty, he would be something besides.'"
766 ""
766 "'What would he be?' said Peggotty."
766 ""
766 "'Angry,' I answered, with an involuntary imitation of his dark frown."
766 "'If he was only sorry, he wouldn't look at me as he does. I am only"
766 "sorry, and it makes me feel kinder.'"
766 ""
766 "Peggotty said nothing for a little while; and I warmed my hands, as"
766 "silent as she."
766 ""
766 "'Davy,' she said at length."
766 ""
766 "'Yes, Peggotty?' 'I have tried, my dear, all ways I could think of--all"
766 "the ways there are, and all the ways there ain't, in short--to get a"
766 "suitable service here, in Blunderstone; but there's no such a thing, my"
766 "love.'"
766 ""
766 "'And what do you mean to do, Peggotty,' says I, wistfully. 'Do you mean"
766 "to go and seek your fortune?'"
766 ""
766 "'I expect I shall be forced to go to Yarmouth,' replied Peggotty, 'and"
766 "live there.'"
766 ""
766 "'You might have gone farther off,' I said, brightening a little, 'and"
766 "been as bad as lost. I shall see you sometimes, my dear old Peggotty,"
766 "there. You won't be quite at the other end of the world, will you?'"
766 ""
766 "'Contrary ways, please God!' cried Peggotty, with great animation. 'As"
766 "long as you are here, my pet, I shall come over every week of my life to"
766 "see you. One day, every week of my life!'"
766 ""
766 "I felt a great weight taken off my mind by this promise: but even this"
766 "was not all, for Peggotty went on to say:"
766 ""
766 "'I'm a-going, Davy, you see, to my brother's, first, for another"
766 "fortnight's visit--just till I have had time to look about me, and"
766 "get to be something like myself again. Now, I have been thinking that"
766 "perhaps, as they don't want you here at present, you might be let to go"
766 "along with me.'"
766 ""
766 "If anything, short of being in a different relation to every one about"
766 "me, Peggotty excepted, could have given me a sense of pleasure at that"
766 "time, it would have been this project of all others. The idea of being"
766 "again surrounded by those honest faces, shining welcome on me; of"
766 "renewing the peacefulness of the sweet Sunday morning, when the bells"
766 "were ringing, the stones dropping in the water, and the shadowy ships"
766 "breaking through the mist; of roaming up and down with little Em'ly,"
766 "telling her my troubles, and finding charms against them in the shells"
766 "and pebbles on the beach; made a calm in my heart. It was ruffled next"
766 "moment, to be sure, by a doubt of Miss Murdstone's giving her consent;"
766 "but even that was set at rest soon, for she came out to take an evening"
766 "grope in the store-closet while we were yet in conversation, and"
766 "Peggotty, with a boldness that amazed me, broached the topic on the"
766 "spot."
766 ""
766 "'The boy will be idle there,' said Miss Murdstone, looking into a"
766 "pickle-jar, 'and idleness is the root of all evil. But, to be sure, he"
766 "would be idle here--or anywhere, in my opinion.'"
766 ""
766 "Peggotty had an angry answer ready, I could see; but she swallowed it"
766 "for my sake, and remained silent."
766 ""
766 "'Humph!' said Miss Murdstone, still keeping her eye on the pickles;"
766 "'it is of more importance than anything else--it is of paramount"
766 "importance--that my brother should not be disturbed or made"
766 "uncomfortable. I suppose I had better say yes.'"
766 ""
766 "I thanked her, without making any demonstration of joy, lest it should"
766 "induce her to withdraw her assent. Nor could I help thinking this a"
766 "prudent course, since she looked at me out of the pickle-jar, with"
766 "as great an access of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its"
766 "contents. However, the permission was given, and was never retracted;"
766 "for when the month was out, Peggotty and I were ready to depart."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Barkis came into the house for Peggotty's boxes. I had never known"
766 "him to pass the garden-gate before, but on this occasion he came into"
766 "the house. And he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and"
766 "went out, which I thought had meaning in it, if meaning could ever be"
766 "said to find its way into Mr. Barkis's visage."
766 ""
766 "Peggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home"
766 "so many years, and where the two strong attachments of her life--for"
766 "my mother and myself--had been formed. She had been walking in the"
766 "churchyard, too, very early; and she got into the cart, and sat in it"
766 "with her handkerchief at her eyes."
766 ""
766 "So long as she remained in this condition, Mr. Barkis gave no sign"
766 "of life whatever. He sat in his usual place and attitude like a great"
766 "stuffed figure. But when she began to look about her, and to speak to"
766 "me, he nodded his head and grinned several times. I have not the least"
766 "notion at whom, or what he meant by it."
766 ""
766 "'It's a beautiful day, Mr. Barkis!' I said, as an act of politeness."
766 ""
766 "'It ain't bad,' said Mr. Barkis, who generally qualified his speech, and"
766 "rarely committed himself."
766 ""
766 "'Peggotty is quite comfortable now, Mr. Barkis,' I remarked, for his"
766 "satisfaction."
766 ""
766 "'Is she, though?' said Mr. Barkis."
766 ""
766 "After reflecting about it, with a sagacious air, Mr. Barkis eyed her,"
766 "and said:"
766 ""
766 "'ARE you pretty comfortable?'"
766 ""
766 "Peggotty laughed, and answered in the affirmative."
766 ""
766 "'But really and truly, you know. Are you?' growled Mr. Barkis, sliding"
766 "nearer to her on the seat, and nudging her with his elbow. 'Are you?"
766 "Really and truly pretty comfortable? Are you? Eh?'"
766 ""
766 "At each of these inquiries Mr. Barkis shuffled nearer to her, and gave"
766 "her another nudge; so that at last we were all crowded together in the"
766 "left-hand corner of the cart, and I was so squeezed that I could hardly"
766 "bear it."
766 ""
766 "Peggotty calling his attention to my sufferings, Mr. Barkis gave me a"
766 "little more room at once, and got away by degrees. But I could not help"
766 "observing that he seemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient"
766 "for expressing himself in a neat, agreeable, and pointed manner, without"
766 "the inconvenience of inventing conversation. He manifestly chuckled over"
766 "it for some time. By and by he turned to Peggotty again, and repeating,"
766 "'Are you pretty comfortable though?' bore down upon us as before, until"
766 "the breath was nearly edged out of my body. By and by he made another"
766 "descent upon us with the same inquiry, and the same result. At length,"
766 "I got up whenever I saw him coming, and standing on the foot-board,"
766 "pretended to look at the prospect; after which I did very well."
766 ""
766 "He was so polite as to stop at a public-house, expressly on our account,"
766 "and entertain us with broiled mutton and beer. Even when Peggotty was"
766 "in the act of drinking, he was seized with one of those approaches, and"
766 "almost choked her. But as we drew nearer to the end of our journey, he"
766 "had more to do and less time for gallantry; and when we got on Yarmouth"
766 "pavement, we were all too much shaken and jolted, I apprehend, to have"
766 "any leisure for anything else."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Peggotty and Ham waited for us at the old place. They received me"
766 "and Peggotty in an affectionate manner, and shook hands with Mr. Barkis,"
766 "who, with his hat on the very back of his head, and a shame-faced leer"
766 "upon his countenance, and pervading his very legs, presented but a"
766 "vacant appearance, I thought. They each took one of Peggotty's trunks,"
766 "and we were going away, when Mr. Barkis solemnly made a sign to me with"
766 "his forefinger to come under an archway."
766 ""
766 "'I say,' growled Mr. Barkis, 'it was all right.'"
766 ""
766 "I looked up into his face, and answered, with an attempt to be very"
766 "profound: 'Oh!'"
766 ""
766 "'It didn't come to a end there,' said Mr. Barkis, nodding"
766 "confidentially. 'It was all right.'"
766 ""
766 "Again I answered, 'Oh!'"
766 ""
766 "'You know who was willin',' said my friend. 'It was Barkis, and Barkis"
766 "only.'"
766 ""
766 "I nodded assent."
766 ""
766 "'It's all right,' said Mr. Barkis, shaking hands; 'I'm a friend of"
766 "your'n. You made it all right, first. It's all right.'"
766 ""
766 "In his attempts to be particularly lucid, Mr. Barkis was so extremely"
766 "mysterious, that I might have stood looking in his face for an hour, and"
766 "most assuredly should have got as much information out of it as out"
766 "of the face of a clock that had stopped, but for Peggotty's calling me"
766 "away. As we were going along, she asked me what he had said; and I told"
766 "her he had said it was all right."
766 ""
766 "'Like his impudence,' said Peggotty, 'but I don't mind that! Davy dear,"
766 "what should you think if I was to think of being married?'"
766 ""
766 "'Why--I suppose you would like me as much then, Peggotty, as you do"
766 "now?' I returned, after a little consideration."
766 ""
766 "Greatly to the astonishment of the passengers in the street, as well as"
766 "of her relations going on before, the good soul was obliged to stop and"
766 "embrace me on the spot, with many protestations of her unalterable love."
766 ""
766 "'Tell me what should you say, darling?' she asked again, when this was"
766 "over, and we were walking on."
766 ""
766 "'If you were thinking of being married--to Mr. Barkis, Peggotty?'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' said Peggotty."
766 ""
766 "'I should think it would be a very good thing. For then you know,"
766 "Peggotty, you would always have the horse and cart to bring you over to"
766 "see me, and could come for nothing, and be sure of coming.'"
766 ""
766 "'The sense of the dear!' cried Peggotty. 'What I have been thinking"
766 "of, this month back! Yes, my precious; and I think I should be more"
766 "independent altogether, you see; let alone my working with a better"
766 "heart in my own house, than I could in anybody else's now. I don't know"
766 "what I might be fit for, now, as a servant to a stranger. And I shall be"
766 "always near my pretty's resting-place,' said Peggotty, musing, 'and be"
766 "able to see it when I like; and when I lie down to rest, I may be laid"
766 "not far off from my darling girl!'"
766 ""
766 "We neither of us said anything for a little while."
766 ""
766 "'But I wouldn't so much as give it another thought,' said Peggotty,"
766 "cheerily 'if my Davy was anyways against it--not if I had been asked in"
766 "church thirty times three times over, and was wearing out the ring in my"
766 "pocket.'"
766 ""
766 "'Look at me, Peggotty,' I replied; 'and see if I am not really glad, and"
766 "don't truly wish it!' As indeed I did, with all my heart."
766 ""
766 "'Well, my life,' said Peggotty, giving me a squeeze, 'I have thought of"
766 "it night and day, every way I can, and I hope the right way; but I'll"
766 "think of it again, and speak to my brother about it, and in the meantime"
766 "we'll keep it to ourselves, Davy, you and me. Barkis is a good plain"
766 "creature,' said Peggotty, 'and if I tried to do my duty by him, I think"
766 "it would be my fault if I wasn't--if I wasn't pretty comfortable,'"
766 "said Peggotty, laughing heartily. This quotation from Mr. Barkis was"
766 "so appropriate, and tickled us both so much, that we laughed again and"
766 "again, and were quite in a pleasant humour when we came within view of"
766 "Mr. Peggotty's cottage."
766 ""
766 "It looked just the same, except that it may, perhaps, have shrunk a"
766 "little in my eyes; and Mrs. Gummidge was waiting at the door as if she"
766 "had stood there ever since. All within was the same, down to the seaweed"
766 "in the blue mug in my bedroom. I went into the out-house to look about"
766 "me; and the very same lobsters, crabs, and crawfish possessed by the"
766 "same desire to pinch the world in general, appeared to be in the same"
766 "state of conglomeration in the same old corner."
766 ""
766 "But there was no little Em'ly to be seen, so I asked Mr. Peggotty where"
766 "she was."
766 ""
766 "'She's at school, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty, wiping the heat consequent"
766 "on the porterage of Peggotty's box from his forehead; 'she'll be home,'"
766 "looking at the Dutch clock, 'in from twenty minutes to half-an-hour's"
766 "time. We all on us feel the loss of her, bless ye!'"
766 ""
766 "Mrs. Gummidge moaned."
766 ""
766 "'Cheer up, Mawther!' cried Mr. Peggotty."
766 ""
766 "'I feel it more than anybody else,' said Mrs. Gummidge; 'I'm a lone"
766 "lorn creetur', and she used to be a'most the only thing that didn't go"
766 "contrary with me.'"
766 ""
766 "Mrs. Gummidge, whimpering and shaking her head, applied herself to"
766 "blowing the fire. Mr. Peggotty, looking round upon us while she was so"
766 "engaged, said in a low voice, which he shaded with his hand: 'The old"
766 "'un!' From this I rightly conjectured that no improvement had taken"
766 "place since my last visit in the state of Mrs. Gummidge's spirits."
766 ""
766 "Now, the whole place was, or it should have been, quite as delightful"
766 "a place as ever; and yet it did not impress me in the same way. I felt"
766 "rather disappointed with it. Perhaps it was because little Em'ly was"
766 "not at home. I knew the way by which she would come, and presently found"
766 "myself strolling along the path to meet her."
766 ""
766 "A figure appeared in the distance before long, and I soon knew it to be"
766 "Em'ly, who was a little creature still in stature, though she was grown."
766 "But when she drew nearer, and I saw her blue eyes looking bluer, and her"
766 "dimpled face looking brighter, and her whole self prettier and gayer, a"
766 "curious feeling came over me that made me pretend not to know her, and"
766 "pass by as if I were looking at something a long way off. I have done"
766 "such a thing since in later life, or I am mistaken."
766 ""
766 "Little Em'ly didn't care a bit. She saw me well enough; but instead of"
766 "turning round and calling after me, ran away laughing. This obliged me"
766 "to run after her, and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage"
766 "before I caught her."
766 ""
766 "'Oh, it's you, is it?' said little Em'ly."
766 ""
766 "'Why, you knew who it was, Em'ly,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'And didn't YOU know who it was?' said Em'ly. I was going to kiss her,"
766 "but she covered her cherry lips with her hands, and said she wasn't a"
766 "baby now, and ran away, laughing more than ever, into the house."
766 ""
766 "She seemed to delight in teasing me, which was a change in her I"
766 "wondered at very much. The tea table was ready, and our little locker"
766 "was put out in its old place, but instead of coming to sit by me, she"
766 "went and bestowed her company upon that grumbling Mrs. Gummidge: and on"
766 "Mr. Peggotty's inquiring why, rumpled her hair all over her face to hide"
766 "it, and could do nothing but laugh."
766 ""
766 "'A little puss, it is!' said Mr. Peggotty, patting her with his great"
766 "hand."
766 ""
766 "'So sh' is! so sh' is!' cried Ham. 'Mas'r Davy bor', so sh' is!' and he"
766 "sat and chuckled at her for some time, in a state of mingled admiration"
766 "and delight, that made his face a burning red."
766 ""
766 "Little Em'ly was spoiled by them all, in fact; and by no one more than"
766 "Mr. Peggotty himself, whom she could have coaxed into anything, by"
766 "only going and laying her cheek against his rough whisker. That was my"
766 "opinion, at least, when I saw her do it; and I held Mr. Peggotty to be"
766 "thoroughly in the right. But she was so affectionate and sweet-natured,"
766 "and had such a pleasant manner of being both sly and shy at once, that"
766 "she captivated me more than ever."
766 ""
766 "She was tender-hearted, too; for when, as we sat round the fire after"
766 "tea, an allusion was made by Mr. Peggotty over his pipe to the loss"
766 "I had sustained, the tears stood in her eyes, and she looked at me so"
766 "kindly across the table, that I felt quite thankful to her."
766 ""
766 "'Ah!' said Mr. Peggotty, taking up her curls, and running them over his"
766 "hand like water, 'here's another orphan, you see, sir. And here,' said"
766 "Mr. Peggotty, giving Ham a backhanded knock in the chest, 'is another of"
766 "'em, though he don't look much like it.'"

766 "head."
766 ""
766 "'Nothing seems to cost him any trouble,' said I. 'He knows a task if he"

766 "at her."
766 ""
766 "'Em'ly is like me,' said Peggotty, 'and would like to see him.'"
766 ""
766 "Em'ly was confused by our all observing her, and hung down her head,"

766 "stray curls, and seeing that we were all looking at her still (I am sure"
766 "I, for one, could have looked at her for hours), she ran away, and kept"
766 "away till it was nearly bedtime."

766 "I lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat, and the wind"
766 "came moaning on across the flat as it had done before. But I could not"
766 "help fancying, now, that it moaned of those who were gone; and instead"
766 "of thinking that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat"
766 "away, I thought of the sea that had risen, since I last heard those"
766 "sounds, and drowned my happy home. I recollect, as the wind and water"
766 "began to sound fainter in my ears, putting a short clause into my"
766 "prayers, petitioning that I might grow up to marry little Em'ly, and so"
766 "dropping lovingly asleep."
766 ""
766 "The days passed pretty much as they had passed before, except--it was"
766 "a great exception--that little Em'ly and I seldom wandered on the beach"
766 "now. She had tasks to learn, and needle-work to do; and was absent"
766 "during a great part of each day. But I felt that we should not have had"
766 "those old wanderings, even if it had been otherwise. Wild and full of"
766 "childish whims as Em'ly was, she was more of a little woman than I"
766 "had supposed. She seemed to have got a great distance away from me,"
766 "in little more than a year. She liked me, but she laughed at me, and"
766 "tormented me; and when I went to meet her, stole home another way, and"
766 "was laughing at the door when I came back, disappointed. The best times"
766 "were when she sat quietly at work in the doorway, and I sat on the"
766 "wooden step at her feet, reading to her. It seems to me, at this"
766 "hour, that I have never seen such sunlight as on those bright April"
766 "afternoons; that I have never seen such a sunny little figure as I used"
766 "to see, sitting in the doorway of the old boat; that I have never beheld"
766 "such sky, such water, such glorified ships sailing away into golden air."
766 ""
766 "On the very first evening after our arrival, Mr. Barkis appeared in an"
766 "exceedingly vacant and awkward condition, and with a bundle of oranges"
766 "tied up in a handkerchief. As he made no allusion of any kind to this"
766 "property, he was supposed to have left it behind him by accident when"
766 "he went away; until Ham, running after him to restore it, came back with"
766 "the information that it was intended for Peggotty. After that occasion"
766 "he appeared every evening at exactly the same hour, and always with a"
766 "little bundle, to which he never alluded, and which he regularly put"
766 "behind the door and left there. These offerings of affection were of a"
766 "most various and eccentric description. Among them I remember a double"
766 "set of pigs' trotters, a huge pin-cushion, half a bushel or so of"
766 "apples, a pair of jet earrings, some Spanish onions, a box of dominoes,"
766 "a canary bird and cage, and a leg of pickled pork."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Barkis's wooing, as I remember it, was altogether of a peculiar"
766 "kind. He very seldom said anything; but would sit by the fire in much"
766 "the same attitude as he sat in his cart, and stare heavily at Peggotty,"
766 "who was opposite. One night, being, as I suppose, inspired by love, he"
766 "made a dart at the bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread, and put"
766 "it in his waistcoat-pocket and carried it off. After that, his great"
766 "delight was to produce it when it was wanted, sticking to the lining of"
766 "his pocket, in a partially melted state, and pocket it again when it was"
766 "done with. He seemed to enjoy himself very much, and not to feel at all"
766 "called upon to talk. Even when he took Peggotty out for a walk on the"
766 "flats, he had no uneasiness on that head, I believe; contenting himself"
766 "with now and then asking her if she was pretty comfortable; and I"
766 "remember that sometimes, after he was gone, Peggotty would throw her"
766 "apron over her face, and laugh for half-an-hour. Indeed, we were"
766 "all more or less amused, except that miserable Mrs. Gummidge, whose"
766 "courtship would appear to have been of an exactly parallel nature, she"
766 "was so continually reminded by these transactions of the old one."

766 "together, and that little Em'ly and I were to accompany them. I had but"
766 "a broken sleep the night before, in anticipation of the pleasure of"
766 "a whole day with Em'ly. We were all astir betimes in the morning; and"

766 "Peggotty was dressed as usual, in her neat and quiet mourning; but Mr."
766 "Barkis bloomed in a new blue coat, of which the tailor had given him"
766 "such good measure, that the cuffs would have rendered gloves unnecessary"
766 "in the coldest weather, while the collar was so high that it pushed his"
766 "hair up on end on the top of his head. His bright buttons, too, were"
766 "of the largest size. Rendered complete by drab pantaloons and a buff"

766 "immediately bursting into tears, and sinking subdued into the arms of"
766 "Ham, with the declaration that she knowed she was a burden, and had"
766 "better be carried to the House at once. Which I really thought was a"
766 "sensible idea, that Ham might have acted on."
766 ""
766 "Away we went, however, on our holiday excursion; and the first thing"
766 "we did was to stop at a church, where Mr. Barkis tied the horse to some"
766 "rails, and went in with Peggotty, leaving little Em'ly and me alone in"
766 "the chaise. I took that occasion to put my arm round Em'ly's waist, and"
766 "propose that as I was going away so very soon now, we should determine"
766 "to be very affectionate to one another, and very happy, all day. Little"
766 "Em'ly consenting, and allowing me to kiss her, I became desperate;"
766 "informing her, I recollect, that I never could love another, and that"
766 "I was prepared to shed the blood of anybody who should aspire to her"
766 "affections."

766 "How merry little Em'ly made herself about it! With what a demure"
766 "assumption of being immensely older and wiser than I, the fairy little"
766 "woman said I was 'a silly boy'; and then laughed so charmingly that"
766 "I forgot the pain of being called by that disparaging name, in the"
766 "pleasure of looking at her."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Barkis and Peggotty were a good while in the church, but came out at"
766 "last, and then we drove away into the country. As we were going along,"
766 "Mr. Barkis turned to me, and said, with a wink,--by the by, I should"
766 "hardly have thought, before, that he could wink:"
766 ""
766 "'What name was it as I wrote up in the cart?'"
766 ""

766 "here?'"
766 ""
766 "'Clara Peggotty, again?' I suggested."
766 ""
766 "'Clara Peggotty BARKIS!' he returned, and burst into a roar of laughter"
766 "that shook the chaise."
766 ""
766 "In a word, they were married, and had gone into the church for no other"
766 "purpose. Peggotty was resolved that it should be quietly done; and"
766 "the clerk had given her away, and there had been no witnesses of the"
766 "ceremony. She was a little confused when Mr. Barkis made this abrupt"
766 "announcement of their union, and could not hug me enough in token of her"
766 "unimpaired affection; but she soon became herself again, and said she"
766 "was very glad it was over."
766 ""
766 "We drove to a little inn in a by-road, where we were expected, and"
766 "where we had a very comfortable dinner, and passed the day with great"
766 "satisfaction. If Peggotty had been married every day for the last ten"
766 "years, she could hardly have been more at her ease about it; it made no"
766 "sort of difference in her: she was just the same as ever, and went"
766 "out for a stroll with little Em'ly and me before tea, while Mr. Barkis"
766 "philosophically smoked his pipe, and enjoyed himself, I suppose, with"
766 "the contemplation of his happiness. If so, it sharpened his appetite;"
766 "for I distinctly call to mind that, although he had eaten a good deal of"
766 "pork and greens at dinner, and had finished off with a fowl or two, he"
766 "was obliged to have cold boiled bacon for tea, and disposed of a large"
766 "quantity without any emotion."
766 ""
766 "I have often thought, since, what an odd, innocent, out-of-the-way kind"
766 "of wedding it must have been! We got into the chaise again soon after"
766 "dark, and drove cosily back, looking up at the stars, and talking about"
766 "them. I was their chief exponent, and opened Mr. Barkis's mind to"
766 "an amazing extent. I told him all I knew, but he would have believed"
766 "anything I might have taken it into my head to impart to him; for he"
766 "had a profound veneration for my abilities, and informed his wife in my"
766 "hearing, on that very occasion, that I was 'a young Roeshus'--by which I"
766 "think he meant prodigy."

766 "When we had exhausted the subject of the stars, or rather when I had"
766 "exhausted the mental faculties of Mr. Barkis, little Em'ly and I made a"

766 "Ah, how I loved her! What happiness (I thought) if we were married,"
766 "and were going away anywhere to live among the trees and in the fields,"
766 "never growing older, never growing wiser, children ever, rambling hand"
766 "in hand through sunshine and among flowery meadows, laying down our"
766 "heads on moss at night, in a sweet sleep of purity and peace, and buried"
766 "by the birds when we were dead! Some such picture, with no real world in"
766 "it, bright with the light of our innocence, and vague as the stars afar"
766 "off, was in my mind all the way. I am glad to think there were two such"
766 "guileless hearts at Peggotty's marriage as little Em'ly's and mine. I"

766 "Well, we came to the old boat again in good time at night; and there"

766 "all that visit; and it was altogether a wonderful close to a wonderful"
766 "day."
766 ""
766 "It was a night tide; and soon after we went to bed, Mr. Peggotty and Ham"
766 "went out to fish. I felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary"
766 "house, the protector of Em'ly and Mrs. Gummidge, and only wished that"
766 "a lion or a serpent, or any ill-disposed monster, would make an attack"
766 "upon us, that I might destroy him, and cover myself with glory. But as"
766 "nothing of the sort happened to be walking about on Yarmouth flats that"
766 "night, I provided the best substitute I could by dreaming of dragons"

766 "After breakfast she took me to her own home, and a beautiful little"
766 "home it was. Of all the moveables in it, I must have been impressed by"
766 "a certain old bureau of some dark wood in the parlour (the tile-floored"
766 "kitchen was the general sitting-room), with a retreating top which"
766 "opened, let down, and became a desk, within which was a large quarto"
766 "edition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. This precious volume, of which I do"
766 "not recollect one word, I immediately discovered and immediately applied"
766 "myself to; and I never visited the house afterwards, but I kneeled on"
766 "a chair, opened the casket where this gem was enshrined, spread my arms"
766 "over the desk, and fell to devouring the book afresh. I was chiefly"
766 "edified, I am afraid, by the pictures, which were numerous, and"
766 "represented all kinds of dismal horrors; but the Martyrs and Peggotty's"
766 "house have been inseparable in my mind ever since, and are now."

766 "I took leave of Mr. Peggotty, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge, and little"

766 "going home in the morning, and I went home in the morning, with herself"
766 "and Mr. Barkis in the cart. They left me at the gate, not easily or"
766 "lightly; and it was a strange sight to me to see the cart go on, taking"
766 "Peggotty away, and leaving me under the old elm-trees looking at the"
766 "house, in which there was no face to look on mine with love or liking"
766 "any more."

766 "steadily, overlooked me. I think Mr. Murdstone's means were straitened"
766 "at about this time; but it is little to the purpose. He could not bear"

766 "I was not actively ill-used. I was not beaten, or starved; but the wrong"

766 "the--to me--extraordinary name of Mealy Potatoes. I discovered, however,"
766 "that this youth had not been christened by that name, but that it had"
766 "been bestowed upon him in the warehouse, on account of his complexion,"
766 "which was pale or mealy. Mealy's father was a waterman, who had the"
766 "additional distinction of being a fireman, and was engaged as such at"

766 "different enough from theirs to place a space between us. They and"

766 "and another named Tipp, who was the carman, and wore a red jacket, used"
766 "to address me sometimes as 'David': but I think it was mostly when we"
766 "were very confidential, and when I had made some efforts to entertain"
766 "them, over our work, with some results of the old readings; which were"

766 "to me; also on a Sunday morning, when I mixed the portion of tea or"
766 "coffee I had bought over-night, in a little shaving-pot, and sat late"
766 "at my breakfast. It was nothing at all unusual for Mr. Micawber to sob"
766 "violently at the beginning of one of these Saturday night conversations,"

766 "it. I have known him come home to supper with a flood of tears, and a"
766 "declaration that nothing was now left but a jail; and go to bed making a"

766 "scolded by his wife every morning. More than once, when I went there"
766 "early, I had audience of him in a turn-up bedstead, with a cut in his"
766 "forehead or a black eye, bearing witness to his excesses over-night (I"
766 "am afraid he was quarrelsome in his drink), and he, with a shaking"

766 "down together. At the pawnbroker's shop, too, I began to be very well"
766 "known. The principal gentleman who officiated behind the counter, took"
766 "a good deal of notice of me; and often got me, I recollect, to decline a"

766 "the sky where the day was coming, reassured me: and my eyes being very"
766 "heavy, I lay down again and slept--though with a knowledge in my sleep"
766 "that it was cold--until the warm beams of the sun, and the ringing of"
766 "the getting-up bell at Salem House, awoke me. If I could have hoped that"
766 "Steerforth was there, I would have lurked about until he came out"
766 "alone; but I knew he must have left long since. Traddles still remained,"
766 "perhaps, but it was very doubtful; and I had not sufficient confidence"
766 "in his discretion or good luck, however strong my reliance was on his"
766 "good nature, to wish to trust him with my situation. So I crept away"
766 "from the wall as Mr. Creakle's boys were getting up, and struck into the"
766 "long dusty track which I had first known to be the Dover Road when I was"

766 "of gardening gloves on her hands, wearing a gardening pocket like a"
766 "toll-man's apron, and carrying a great knife. I knew her immediately"
766 "to be Miss Betsey, for she came stalking out of the house exactly as"
766 "my poor mother had so often described her stalking up our garden at"
766 "Blunderstone Rookery."
766 ""
766 "'Go away!' said Miss Betsey, shaking her head, and making a distant chop"
766 "in the air with her knife. 'Go along! No boys here!'"
766 ""
766 "I watched her, with my heart at my lips, as she marched to a corner of"
766 "her garden, and stooped to dig up some little root there. Then, without"
766 "a scrap of courage, but with a great deal of desperation, I went softly"
766 "in and stood beside her, touching her with my finger."
766 ""
766 "'If you please, ma'am,' I began."
766 ""
766 "She started and looked up."
766 ""
766 "'If you please, aunt.'"

766 "'EH?' exclaimed Miss Betsey, in a tone of amazement I have never heard"
766 "approached."
766 ""
766 "'If you please, aunt, I am your nephew.'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh, Lord!' said my aunt. And sat flat down in the garden-path."
766 ""
766 "'I am David Copperfield, of Blunderstone, in Suffolk--where you came,"
766 "on the night when I was born, and saw my dear mama. I have been very"
766 "unhappy since she died. I have been slighted, and taught nothing, and"
766 "thrown upon myself, and put to work not fit for me. It made me run away"
766 "to you. I was robbed at first setting out, and have walked all the"
766 "way, and have never slept in a bed since I began the journey.' Here"
766 "my self-support gave way all at once; and with a movement of my hands,"
766 "intended to show her my ragged state, and call it to witness that I had"
766 "suffered something, I broke into a passion of crying, which I suppose"
766 "had been pent up within me all the week."
766 ""
766 "My aunt, with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her"
766 "countenance, sat on the gravel, staring at me, until I began to cry;"
766 "when she got up in a great hurry, collared me, and took me into the"
766 "parlour. Her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press, bring"
766 "out several bottles, and pour some of the contents of each into my"
766 "mouth. I think they must have been taken out at random, for I am sure"
766 "I tasted aniseed water, anchovy sauce, and salad dressing. When she had"
766 "administered these restoratives, as I was still quite hysterical, and"
766 "unable to control my sobs, she put me on the sofa, with a shawl under"
766 "my head, and the handkerchief from her own head under my feet, lest I"
766 "should sully the cover; and then, sitting herself down behind the green"
766 "fan or screen I have already mentioned, so that I could not see her"
766 "face, ejaculated at intervals, 'Mercy on us!' letting those exclamations"
766 "off like minute guns."
766 ""
766 "After a time she rang the bell. 'Janet,' said my aunt, when her servant"
766 "came in. 'Go upstairs, give my compliments to Mr. Dick, and say I wish"
766 "to speak to him.'"
766 ""
766 "Janet looked a little surprised to see me lying stiffly on the sofa (I"
766 "was afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt), but went"
766 "on her errand. My aunt, with her hands behind her, walked up and down"
766 "the room, until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper"
766 "window came in laughing."
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Dick,' said my aunt, 'don't be a fool, because nobody can be more"
766 "discreet than you can, when you choose. We all know that. So don't be a"
766 "fool, whatever you are.'"
766 ""
766 "The gentleman was serious immediately, and looked at me, I thought, as"
766 "if he would entreat me to say nothing about the window."
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Dick,' said my aunt, 'you have heard me mention David Copperfield?"
766 "Now don't pretend not to have a memory, because you and I know better.'"
766 ""
766 "'David Copperfield?' said Mr. Dick, who did not appear to me to"
766 "remember much about it. 'David Copperfield? Oh yes, to be sure. David,"
766 "certainly.'"
766 ""
766 "'Well,' said my aunt, 'this is his boy--his son. He would be as like his"
766 "father as it's possible to be, if he was not so like his mother, too.'"
766 ""
766 "'His son?' said Mr. Dick. 'David's son? Indeed!'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' pursued my aunt, 'and he has done a pretty piece of business."
766 "He has run away. Ah! His sister, Betsey Trotwood, never would have run"
766 "away.' My aunt shook her head firmly, confident in the character and"
766 "behaviour of the girl who never was born."
766 ""
766 "'Oh! you think she wouldn't have run away?' said Mr. Dick."
766 ""
766 "'Bless and save the man,' exclaimed my aunt, sharply, 'how he talks!"
766 "Don't I know she wouldn't? She would have lived with her god-mother,"
766 "and we should have been devoted to one another. Where, in the name of"
766 "wonder, should his sister, Betsey Trotwood, have run from, or to?'"
766 ""
766 "'Nowhere,' said Mr. Dick."
766 ""
766 "'Well then,' returned my aunt, softened by the reply, 'how can you"
766 "pretend to be wool-gathering, Dick, when you are as sharp as a surgeon's"
766 "lancet? Now, here you see young David Copperfield, and the question I"
766 "put to you is, what shall I do with him?'"
766 ""
766 "'What shall you do with him?' said Mr. Dick, feebly, scratching his"
766 "head. 'Oh! do with him?'"

766 "'Come! I want some very sound advice.'"
766 ""
766 "'Why, if I was you,' said Mr. Dick, considering, and looking vacantly"
766 "at me, 'I should--' The contemplation of me seemed to inspire him with a"
766 "sudden idea, and he added, briskly, 'I should wash him!'"
766 ""
766 "'Janet,' said my aunt, turning round with a quiet triumph, which I did"
766 "not then understand, 'Mr. Dick sets us all right. Heat the bath!'"
766 ""
766 "Although I was deeply interested in this dialogue, I could not help"
766 "observing my aunt, Mr. Dick, and Janet, while it was in progress, and"
766 "completing a survey I had already been engaged in making of the room."
766 ""
766 "My aunt was a tall, hard-featured lady, but by no means ill-looking."
766 "There was an inflexibility in her face, in her voice, in her gait and"
766 "carriage, amply sufficient to account for the effect she had made upon"
766 "a gentle creature like my mother; but her features were rather handsome"
766 "than otherwise, though unbending and austere. I particularly noticed"
766 "that she had a very quick, bright eye. Her hair, which was grey, was"
766 "arranged in two plain divisions, under what I believe would be called a"
766 "mob-cap; I mean a cap, much more common then than now, with side-pieces"
766 "fastening under the chin. Her dress was of a lavender colour, and"
766 "perfectly neat; but scantily made, as if she desired to be as little"
766 "encumbered as possible. I remember that I thought it, in form, more like"
766 "a riding-habit with the superfluous skirt cut off, than anything else."
766 "She wore at her side a gentleman's gold watch, if I might judge from its"
766 "size and make, with an appropriate chain and seals; she had some linen"
766 "at her throat not unlike a shirt-collar, and things at her wrists like"
766 "little shirt-wristbands."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Dick, as I have already said, was grey-headed, and florid: I should"
766 "have said all about him, in saying so, had not his head been curiously"
766 "bowed--not by age; it reminded me of one of Mr. Creakle's boys' heads"
766 "after a beating--and his grey eyes prominent and large, with a strange"
766 "kind of watery brightness in them that made me, in combination with his"
766 "vacant manner, his submission to my aunt, and his childish delight when"
766 "she praised him, suspect him of being a little mad; though, if he were"
766 "mad, how he came to be there puzzled me extremely. He was dressed"
766 "like any other ordinary gentleman, in a loose grey morning coat and"
766 "waistcoat, and white trousers; and had his watch in his fob, and his"
766 "money in his pockets: which he rattled as if he were very proud of it."
766 ""
766 "Janet was a pretty blooming girl, of about nineteen or twenty, and a"
766 "perfect picture of neatness. Though I made no further observation of"
766 "her at the moment, I may mention here what I did not discover until"
766 "afterwards, namely, that she was one of a series of protegees whom my"
766 "aunt had taken into her service expressly to educate in a renouncement"
766 "of mankind, and who had generally completed their abjuration by marrying"
766 "the baker."

766 "moment since, to think of it, the air from the sea came blowing"
766 "in again, mixed with the perfume of the flowers; and I saw the"
766 "old-fashioned furniture brightly rubbed and polished, my aunt's"
766 "inviolable chair and table by the round green fan in the bow-window, the"
766 "drugget-covered carpet, the cat, the kettle-holder, the two canaries,"
766 "the old china, the punchbowl full of dried rose-leaves, the tall press"
766 "guarding all sorts of bottles and pots, and, wonderfully out of keeping"
766 "with the rest, my dusty self upon the sofa, taking note of everything."
766 ""
766 "Janet had gone away to get the bath ready, when my aunt, to my great"
766 "alarm, became in one moment rigid with indignation, and had hardly voice"
766 "to cry out, 'Janet! Donkeys!'"
766 ""
766 "Upon which, Janet came running up the stairs as if the house were in"
766 "flames, darted out on a little piece of green in front, and warned off"
766 "two saddle-donkeys, lady-ridden, that had presumed to set hoof upon it;"
766 "while my aunt, rushing out of the house, seized the bridle of a third"
766 "animal laden with a bestriding child, turned him, led him forth from"
766 "those sacred precincts, and boxed the ears of the unlucky urchin in"
766 "attendance who had dared to profane that hallowed ground."
766 ""
766 "To this hour I don't know whether my aunt had any lawful right of way"
766 "over that patch of green; but she had settled it in her own mind that"
766 "she had, and it was all the same to her. The one great outrage of her"
766 "life, demanding to be constantly avenged, was the passage of a donkey"
766 "over that immaculate spot. In whatever occupation she was engaged,"
766 "however interesting to her the conversation in which she was taking"
766 "part, a donkey turned the current of her ideas in a moment, and she was"
766 "upon him straight. Jugs of water, and watering-pots, were kept in secret"
766 "places ready to be discharged on the offending boys; sticks were laid"
766 "in ambush behind the door; sallies were made at all hours; and"
766 "incessant war prevailed. Perhaps this was an agreeable excitement to the"
766 "donkey-boys; or perhaps the more sagacious of the donkeys, understanding"
766 "how the case stood, delighted with constitutional obstinacy in coming"
766 "that way. I only know that there were three alarms before the bath was"
766 "ready; and that on the occasion of the last and most desperate of all,"
766 "I saw my aunt engage, single-handed, with a sandy-headed lad of fifteen,"
766 "and bump his sandy head against her own gate, before he seemed to"
766 "comprehend what was the matter. These interruptions were of the more"
766 "ridiculous to me, because she was giving me broth out of a table-spoon"
766 "at the time (having firmly persuaded herself that I was actually"
766 "starving, and must receive nourishment at first in very small"
766 "quantities), and, while my mouth was yet open to receive the spoon, she"
766 "would put it back into the basin, cry 'Janet! Donkeys!' and go out to"
766 "the assault."
766 ""
766 "The bath was a great comfort. For I began to be sensible of acute pains"
766 "in my limbs from lying out in the fields, and was now so tired and low"
766 "that I could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together. When I"
766 "had bathed, they (I mean my aunt and Janet) enrobed me in a shirt and a"
766 "pair of trousers belonging to Mr. Dick, and tied me up in two or three"
766 "great shawls. What sort of bundle I looked like, I don't know, but I"
766 "felt a very hot one. Feeling also very faint and drowsy, I soon lay down"
766 "on the sofa again and fell asleep."
766 ""
766 "It might have been a dream, originating in the fancy which had occupied"
766 "my mind so long, but I awoke with the impression that my aunt had come"
766 "and bent over me, and had put my hair away from my face, and laid my"
766 "head more comfortably, and had then stood looking at me. The words,"
766 "'Pretty fellow,' or 'Poor fellow,' seemed to be in my ears, too; but"
766 "certainly there was nothing else, when I awoke, to lead me to believe"
766 "that they had been uttered by my aunt, who sat in the bow-window gazing"
766 "at the sea from behind the green fan, which was mounted on a kind of"
766 "swivel, and turned any way."

766 "We dined soon after I awoke, off a roast fowl and a pudding; I sitting"
766 "at table, not unlike a trussed bird myself, and moving my arms with"

766 "complaint of being inconvenienced. All this time I was deeply anxious"
766 "to know what she was going to do with me; but she took her dinner in"
766 "profound silence, except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me"

766 "which she elicited from me, gradually, by a course of questions. During"
766 "my recital, she kept her eyes on Mr. Dick, who I thought would have gone"

766 "I should like to know! She had had one husband. She had seen David"

766 "'Well,' returned Mr. Dick, scratching his ear with his pen, and looking"
766 "dubiously at me. 'So the books say; but I don't see how that can be."

766 "one or two places."

766 "strongly on the subject, I tried to look as if I felt strongly too."
766 ""
766 "'A proud fool!' said my aunt. 'Because his brother was a little"
766 "eccentric--though he is not half so eccentric as a good many people--he"
766 "didn't like to have him visible about his house, and sent him away to"
766 "some private asylum-place: though he had been left to his particular"

766 "convinced also."

766 "of Mr. Dick (that's not madness, I hope!) that, combined with his fear"
766 "of his brother, and his sense of his unkindness, it threw him into a"
766 "fever. That was before he came to me, but the recollection of it is"

766 "'Yes, aunt.'"

766 "with great disturbance and agitation, naturally, and that's the figure,"
766 "or the simile, or whatever it's called, which he chooses to use. And why"
766 "shouldn't he, if he thinks proper!'"

766 ""
766 "'Is it a Memorial about his own history that he is writing, aunt?'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes, child,' said my aunt, rubbing her nose again. 'He is memorializing"

766 "suppose it will go in, one of these days. He hasn't been able to draw"
766 "it up yet, without introducing that mode of expressing himself; but it"
766 "don't signify; it keeps him employed.'"

766 ""
766 "'I say again,' said my aunt, 'nobody knows what that man's mind is"

766 "existence. If he likes to fly a kite sometimes, what of that! Franklin"
766 "used to fly a kite. He was a Quaker, or something of that sort, if I"

766 "from such a mark of her good opinion. But I could hardly help observing"
766 "that she had launched into them, chiefly because the question was raised"
766 "in her own mind, and with very little reference to me, though she had"

766 "At the same time, I must say that the generosity of her championship"

766 "I believe that I began to know that there was something about my aunt,"
766 "notwithstanding her many eccentricities and odd humours, to be honoured"
766 "and trusted in. Though she was just as sharp that day as on the day"
766 "before, and was in and out about the donkeys just as often, and was"

766 "The anxiety I underwent, in the interval which necessarily elapsed"

766 "extreme; but I made an endeavour to suppress it, and to be as agreeable"
766 "as I could in a quiet way, both to my aunt and Mr. Dick. The latter and"
766 "I would have gone out to fly the great kite; but that I had still no"
766 "other clothes than the anything but ornamental garments with which I"
766 "had been decorated on the first day, and which confined me to the house,"
766 "except for an hour after dark, when my aunt, for my health's sake,"
766 "paraded me up and down on the cliff outside, before going to bed. At"
766 "length the reply from Mr. Murdstone came, and my aunt informed me, to my"
766 "infinite terror, that he was coming to speak to her herself on the next"
766 "day. On the next day, still bundled up in my curious habiliments, I sat"
766 "counting the time, flushed and heated by the conflict of sinking hopes"

766 "Lead him off!' and I saw, from behind my aunt, a sort of hurried"
766 "battle-piece, in which the donkey stood resisting everybody, with all"
766 "his four legs planted different ways, while Janet tried to pull him"
766 "round by the bridle, Mr. Murdstone tried to lead him on, Miss Murdstone"

766 "the ground, into the garden, and, calling upon Janet to fetch the"
766 "constables and justices, that he might be taken, tried, and executed on"
766 "the spot, held him at bay there. This part of the business, however, did"
766 "not last long; for the young rascal, being expert at a variety of feints"

766 "and Miss Murdstone's face as she heard it. But the manner of the speech,"
766 "no less than the matter, was so fiery, that Miss Murdstone, without a"

766 "guardians, in my aunt and Mr. Dick. I never thought of anything about"
766 "myself, distinctly. The two things clearest in my mind were, that a"
766 "remoteness had come upon the old Blunderstone life--which seemed to lie"
766 "in the haze of an immeasurable distance; and that a curtain had for ever"
766 "fallen on my life at Murdstone and Grinby's. No one has ever raised that"
766 "curtain since. I have lifted it for a moment, even in this narrative,"
766 "with a reluctant hand, and dropped it gladly. The remembrance of that"
766 "life is fraught with so much pain to me, with so much mental suffering"
766 "and want of hope, that I have never had the courage even to examine how"
766 "long I was doomed to lead it. Whether it lasted for a year, or more, or"

766 "Mr. Dick and I soon became the best of friends, and very often, when his"
766 "day's work was done, went out together to fly the great kite. Every day"
766 "of his life he had a long sitting at the Memorial, which never made the"
766 "least progress, however hard he laboured, for King Charles the First"
766 "always strayed into it, sooner or later, and then it was thrown aside,"
766 "and another one begun. The patience and hope with which he bore these"
766 "perpetual disappointments, the mild perception he had that there was"
766 "something wrong about King Charles the First, the feeble efforts he made"
766 "to keep him out, and the certainty with which he came in, and tumbled"
766 "the Memorial out of all shape, made a deep impression on me. What Mr."
766 "Dick supposed would come of the Memorial, if it were completed; where he"
766 "thought it was to go, or what he thought it was to do; he knew no more"
766 "than anybody else, I believe. Nor was it at all necessary that he should"
766 "trouble himself with such questions, for if anything were certain under"
766 "the sun, it was certain that the Memorial never would be finished. It"
766 "was quite an affecting sight, I used to think, to see him with the kite"
766 "when it was up a great height in the air. What he had told me, in his"
766 "room, about his belief in its disseminating the statements pasted on it,"
766 "which were nothing but old leaves of abortive Memorials, might have been"
766 "a fancy with him sometimes; but not when he was out, looking up at"
766 "the kite in the sky, and feeling it pull and tug at his hand. He never"
766 "looked so serene as he did then. I used to fancy, as I sat by him of an"
766 "evening, on a green slope, and saw him watch the kite high in the quiet"
766 "air, that it lifted his mind out of its confusion, and bore it (such was"
766 "my boyish thought) into the skies. As he wound the string in and it came"
766 "lower and lower down out of the beautiful light, until it fluttered to"
766 "the ground, and lay there like a dead thing, he seemed to wake gradually"
766 "out of a dream; and I remember to have seen him take it up, and look"
766 "about him in a lost way, as if they had both come down together, so that"
766 "I pitied him with all my heart."

766 "adopted name of Trotwood into Trot; and even encouraged me to hope, that"

766 "consequence, that my aunt, after giving him several admonitory raps on"
766 "the knuckles with her dice-box, shut up the board, and declined to play"
766 "with him any more. But, on hearing from my aunt that I should sometimes"
766 "come over on a Saturday, and that he could sometimes come and see me"
766 "on a Wednesday, he revived; and vowed to make another kite for those"
766 "occasions, of proportions greatly surpassing the present one. In the"
766 "morning he was downhearted again, and would have sustained himself by"
766 "giving me all the money he had in his possession, gold and silver too,"

766 "gentleman of the county; 'what wind blows you here? Not an ill wind, I"
766 "hope?'"
766 ""
766 "'No,' replied my aunt. 'I have not come for any law.'"
766 ""
766 "'That's right, ma'am,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'You had better come for"
766 "anything else.' His hair was quite white now, though his eyebrows were"
766 "still black. He had a very agreeable face, and, I thought, was handsome."
766 "There was a certain richness in his complexion, which I had been long"
766 "accustomed, under Peggotty's tuition, to connect with port wine; and I"
766 "fancied it was in his voice too, and referred his growing corpulency"
766 "to the same cause. He was very cleanly dressed, in a blue coat, striped"
766 "waistcoat, and nankeen trousers; and his fine frilled shirt and cambric"
766 "neckcloth looked unusually soft and white, reminding my strolling fancy"
766 "(I call to mind) of the plumage on the breast of a swan."
766 ""
766 "'This is my nephew,' said my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'Wasn't aware you had one, Miss Trotwood,' said Mr. Wickfield."
766 ""
766 "'My grand-nephew, that is to say,' observed my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'Wasn't aware you had a grand-nephew, I give you my word,' said Mr."
766 "Wickfield."
766 ""
766 "'I have adopted him,' said my aunt, with a wave of her hand, importing"
766 "that his knowledge and his ignorance were all one to her, 'and I have"
766 "brought him here, to put to a school where he may be thoroughly well"
766 "taught, and well treated. Now tell me where that school is, and what it"
766 "is, and all about it.'"
766 ""
766 "'Before I can advise you properly,' said Mr. Wickfield--'the old"
766 "question, you know. What's your motive in this?'"
766 ""
766 "'Deuce take the man!' exclaimed my aunt. 'Always fishing for motives,"
766 "when they're on the surface! Why, to make the child happy and useful.'"
766 ""
766 "'It must be a mixed motive, I think,' said Mr. Wickfield, shaking his"
766 "head and smiling incredulously."
766 ""
766 "'A mixed fiddlestick,' returned my aunt. 'You claim to have one plain"
766 "motive in all you do yourself. You don't suppose, I hope, that you are"
766 "the only plain dealer in the world?'"
766 ""
766 "'Ay, but I have only one motive in life, Miss Trotwood,' he rejoined,"
766 "smiling. 'Other people have dozens, scores, hundreds. I have only one."
766 "There's the difference. However, that's beside the question. The best"
766 "school? Whatever the motive, you want the best?'"
766 ""
766 "My aunt nodded assent."
766 ""
766 "'At the best we have,' said Mr. Wickfield, considering, 'your nephew"
766 "couldn't board just now.'"
766 ""
766 "'But he could board somewhere else, I suppose?' suggested my aunt."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Wickfield thought I could. After a little discussion, he proposed to"
766 "take my aunt to the school, that she might see it and judge for herself;"
766 "also, to take her, with the same object, to two or three houses where he"
766 "thought I could be boarded. My aunt embracing the proposal, we were all"
766 "three going out together, when he stopped and said:"
766 ""
766 "'Our little friend here might have some motive, perhaps, for objecting"
766 "to the arrangements. I think we had better leave him behind?'"
766 ""
766 "My aunt seemed disposed to contest the point; but to facilitate matters"
766 "I said I would gladly remain behind, if they pleased; and returned into"
766 "Mr. Wickfield's office, where I sat down again, in the chair I had first"
766 "occupied, to await their return."
766 ""
766 "It so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage, which"
766 "ended in the little circular room where I had seen Uriah Heep's pale"
766 "face looking out of the window. Uriah, having taken the pony to a"
766 "neighbouring stable, was at work at a desk in this room, which had a"
766 "brass frame on the top to hang paper upon, and on which the writing he"
766 "was making a copy of was then hanging. Though his face was towards me, I"
766 "thought, for some time, the writing being between us, that he could not"
766 "see me; but looking that way more attentively, it made me uncomfortable"
766 "to observe that, every now and then, his sleepless eyes would come below"
766 "the writing, like two red suns, and stealthily stare at me for I dare"
766 "say a whole minute at a time, during which his pen went, or pretended"
766 "to go, as cleverly as ever. I made several attempts to get out of their"
766 "way--such as standing on a chair to look at a map on the other side of"
766 "the room, and poring over the columns of a Kentish newspaper--but they"
766 "always attracted me back again; and whenever I looked towards those two"
766 "red suns, I was sure to find them, either just rising or just setting."
766 ""
766 "At length, much to my relief, my aunt and Mr. Wickfield came back,"
766 "after a pretty long absence. They were not so successful as I could have"
766 "wished; for though the advantages of the school were undeniable, my aunt"
766 "had not approved of any of the boarding-houses proposed for me."
766 ""
766 "'It's very unfortunate,' said my aunt. 'I don't know what to do, Trot.'"
766 ""
766 "'It does happen unfortunately,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'But I'll tell you"
766 "what you can do, Miss Trotwood.'"
766 ""
766 "'What's that?' inquired my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'Leave your nephew here, for the present. He's a quiet fellow. He"
766 "won't disturb me at all. It's a capital house for study. As quiet as a"
766 "monastery, and almost as roomy. Leave him here.'"
766 ""
766 "My aunt evidently liked the offer, though she was delicate of accepting"
766 "it. So did I. 'Come, Miss Trotwood,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'This is the"
766 "way out of the difficulty. It's only a temporary arrangement, you know."
766 "If it don't act well, or don't quite accord with our mutual convenience,"
766 "he can easily go to the right-about. There will be time to find some"
766 "better place for him in the meanwhile. You had better determine to leave"
766 "him here for the present!'"
766 ""
766 "'I am very much obliged to you,' said my aunt; 'and so is he, I see;"
766 "but--'"
766 ""
766 "'Come! I know what you mean,' cried Mr. Wickfield. 'You shall not be"
766 "oppressed by the receipt of favours, Miss Trotwood. You may pay for"
766 "him, if you like. We won't be hard about terms, but you shall pay if you"
766 "will.'"
766 ""
766 "'On that understanding,' said my aunt, 'though it doesn't lessen the"
766 "real obligation, I shall be very glad to leave him.'"
766 ""
766 "'Then come and see my little housekeeper,' said Mr. Wickfield."
766 ""
766 "We accordingly went up a wonderful old staircase; with a balustrade"
766 "so broad that we might have gone up that, almost as easily; and into"
766 "a shady old drawing-room, lighted by some three or four of the quaint"
766 "windows I had looked up at from the street: which had old oak seats"
766 "in them, that seemed to have come of the same trees as the shining oak"
766 "floor, and the great beams in the ceiling. It was a prettily furnished"
766 "room, with a piano and some lively furniture in red and green, and some"
766 "flowers. It seemed to be all old nooks and corners; and in every nook"
766 "and corner there was some queer little table, or cupboard, or bookcase,"
766 "or seat, or something or other, that made me think there was not such"
766 "another good corner in the room; until I looked at the next one, and"
766 "found it equal to it, if not better. On everything there was the same"
766 "air of retirement and cleanliness that marked the house outside."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Wickfield tapped at a door in a corner of the panelled wall, and a"
766 "girl of about my own age came quickly out and kissed him. On her face,"
766 "I saw immediately the placid and sweet expression of the lady whose"
766 "picture had looked at me downstairs. It seemed to my imagination as"
766 "if the portrait had grown womanly, and the original remained a child."
766 "Although her face was quite bright and happy, there was a tranquillity"
766 "about it, and about her--a quiet, good, calm spirit--that I never have"
766 "forgotten; that I shall never forget. This was his little housekeeper,"
766 "his daughter Agnes, Mr. Wickfield said. When I heard how he said it, and"
766 "saw how he held her hand, I guessed what the one motive of his life was."
766 ""
766 "She had a little basket-trifle hanging at her side, with keys in it; and"
766 "she looked as staid and as discreet a housekeeper as the old house"
766 "could have. She listened to her father as he told her about me, with a"
766 "pleasant face; and when he had concluded, proposed to my aunt that we"
766 "should go upstairs and see my room. We all went together, she before us:"
766 "and a glorious old room it was, with more oak beams, and diamond panes;"
766 "and the broad balustrade going all the way up to it."
766 ""
766 "I cannot call to mind where or when, in my childhood, I had seen a"
766 "stained glass window in a church. Nor do I recollect its subject. But"
766 "I know that when I saw her turn round, in the grave light of the old"
766 "staircase, and wait for us, above, I thought of that window; and I"
766 "associated something of its tranquil brightness with Agnes Wickfield"
766 "ever afterwards."
766 ""
766 "My aunt was as happy as I was, in the arrangement made for me; and we"
766 "went down to the drawing-room again, well pleased and gratified. As she"
766 "would not hear of staying to dinner, lest she should by any chance fail"
766 "to arrive at home with the grey pony before dark; and as I apprehend Mr."
766 "Wickfield knew her too well to argue any point with her; some lunch was"
766 "provided for her there, and Agnes went back to her governess, and Mr."
766 "Wickfield to his office. So we were left to take leave of one another"
766 "without any restraint."
766 ""
766 "She told me that everything would be arranged for me by Mr. Wickfield,"
766 "and that I should want for nothing, and gave me the kindest words and"
766 "the best advice."
766 ""
766 "'Trot,' said my aunt in conclusion, 'be a credit to yourself, to me, and"
766 "Mr. Dick, and Heaven be with you!'"
766 ""
766 "I was greatly overcome, and could only thank her, again and again, and"
766 "send my love to Mr. Dick."
766 ""
766 "'Never,' said my aunt, 'be mean in anything; never be false; never be"
766 "cruel. Avoid those three vices, Trot, and I can always be hopeful of"
766 "you.'"
766 ""
766 "I promised, as well as I could, that I would not abuse her kindness or"
766 "forget her admonition."
766 ""
766 "'The pony's at the door,' said my aunt, 'and I am off! Stay here.' With"
766 "these words she embraced me hastily, and went out of the room, shutting"
766 "the door after her. At first I was startled by so abrupt a departure,"
766 "and almost feared I had displeased her; but when I looked into the"
766 "street, and saw how dejectedly she got into the chaise, and drove away"
766 "without looking up, I understood her better and did not do her that"
766 "injustice."
766 ""
766 "By five o'clock, which was Mr. Wickfield's dinner-hour, I had mustered"
766 "up my spirits again, and was ready for my knife and fork. The cloth was"
766 "only laid for us two; but Agnes was waiting in the drawing-room before"
766 "dinner, went down with her father, and sat opposite to him at table. I"
766 "doubted whether he could have dined without her."
766 ""
766 "We did not stay there, after dinner, but came upstairs into the"
766 "drawing-room again: in one snug corner of which, Agnes set glasses for"
766 "her father, and a decanter of port wine. I thought he would have missed"
766 "its usual flavour, if it had been put there for him by any other hands."
766 ""
766 "There he sat, taking his wine, and taking a good deal of it, for two"
766 "hours; while Agnes played on the piano, worked, and talked to him and"
766 "me. He was, for the most part, gay and cheerful with us; but sometimes"
766 "his eyes rested on her, and he fell into a brooding state, and was"
766 "silent. She always observed this quickly, I thought, and always roused"
766 "him with a question or caress. Then he came out of his meditation, and"
766 "drank more wine."
766 ""
766 "Agnes made the tea, and presided over it; and the time passed away after"
766 "it, as after dinner, until she went to bed; when her father took her"
766 "in his arms and kissed her, and, she being gone, ordered candles in his"
766 "office. Then I went to bed too."
766 ""
766 "But in the course of the evening I had rambled down to the door, and a"
766 "little way along the street, that I might have another peep at the old"
766 "houses, and the grey Cathedral; and might think of my coming through"
766 "that old city on my journey, and of my passing the very house I lived"
766 "in, without knowing it. As I came back, I saw Uriah Heep shutting up"
766 "the office; and feeling friendly towards everybody, went in and spoke"
766 "to him, and at parting, gave him my hand. But oh, what a clammy hand his"
766 "was! as ghostly to the touch as to the sight! I rubbed mine afterwards,"
766 "to warm it, AND TO RUB HIS OFF."
766 ""
766 "It was such an uncomfortable hand, that, when I went to my room, it was"
766 "still cold and wet upon my memory. Leaning out of the window, and seeing"
766 "one of the faces on the beam-ends looking at me sideways, I fancied it"
766 "was Uriah Heep got up there somehow, and shut him out in a hurry."

766 "<CHAPTER 16. I AM A NEW BOY IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE>"
766 ""
766 ""
766 "Next morning, after breakfast, I entered on school life again. I went,"
766 "accompanied by Mr. Wickfield, to the scene of my future studies--a grave"
766 "building in a courtyard, with a learned air about it that seemed very"
766 "well suited to the stray rooks and jackdaws who came down from the"
766 "Cathedral towers to walk with a clerkly bearing on the grass-plot--and"
766 "was introduced to my new master, Doctor Strong."
766 ""
766 "Doctor Strong looked almost as rusty, to my thinking, as the tall iron"
766 "rails and gates outside the house; and almost as stiff and heavy as the"
766 "great stone urns that flanked them, and were set up, on the top of"
766 "the red-brick wall, at regular distances all round the court, like"
766 "sublimated skittles, for Time to play at. He was in his library (I mean"
766 "Doctor Strong was), with his clothes not particularly well brushed, and"
766 "his hair not particularly well combed; his knee-smalls unbraced; his"
766 "long black gaiters unbuttoned; and his shoes yawning like two caverns on"
766 "the hearth-rug. Turning upon me a lustreless eye, that reminded me of"
766 "a long-forgotten blind old horse who once used to crop the grass, and"
766 "tumble over the graves, in Blunderstone churchyard, he said he was glad"
766 "to see me: and then he gave me his hand; which I didn't know what to do"
766 "with, as it did nothing for itself."
766 ""
766 "But, sitting at work, not far from Doctor Strong, was a very pretty"
766 "young lady--whom he called Annie, and who was his daughter, I"
766 "supposed--who got me out of my difficulty by kneeling down to put Doctor"
766 "Strong's shoes on, and button his gaiters, which she did with great"
766 "cheerfulness and quickness. When she had finished, and we were going"
766 "out to the schoolroom, I was much surprised to hear Mr. Wickfield,"
766 "in bidding her good morning, address her as 'Mrs. Strong'; and I was"
766 "wondering could she be Doctor Strong's son's wife, or could she be Mrs."
766 "Doctor Strong, when Doctor Strong himself unconsciously enlightened me."
766 ""
766 "'By the by, Wickfield,' he said, stopping in a passage with his hand on"
766 "my shoulder; 'you have not found any suitable provision for my wife's"
766 "cousin yet?'"
766 ""
766 "'No,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'No. Not yet.'"
766 ""
766 "'I could wish it done as soon as it can be done, Wickfield,' said"
766 "Doctor Strong, 'for Jack Maldon is needy, and idle; and of those two"
766 "bad things, worse things sometimes come. What does Doctor Watts say,' he"
766 "added, looking at me, and moving his head to the time of his quotation,"
766 "'\"Satan finds some mischief still, for idle hands to do.\"'"
766 ""
766 "'Egad, Doctor,' returned Mr. Wickfield, 'if Doctor Watts knew mankind,"
766 "he might have written, with as much truth, \"Satan finds some mischief"
766 "still, for busy hands to do.\" The busy people achieve their full share"
766 "of mischief in the world, you may rely upon it. What have the people"
766 "been about, who have been the busiest in getting money, and in getting"
766 "power, this century or two? No mischief?'"

766 "'Perhaps not,' said Mr. Wickfield; 'and you bring me back to the"
766 "question, with an apology for digressing. No, I have not been able"
766 "to dispose of Mr. Jack Maldon yet. I believe,' he said this with some"
766 "hesitation, 'I penetrate your motive, and it makes the thing more"
766 "difficult.'"
766 ""
766 "'My motive,' returned Doctor Strong, 'is to make some suitable provision"
766 "for a cousin, and an old playfellow, of Annie's.'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes, I know,' said Mr. Wickfield; 'at home or abroad.'"
766 ""

766 "words so much. 'At home or abroad.'"
766 ""
766 "'Your own expression, you know,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'Or abroad.'"

766 ""
766 "Doctor Strong regarded him with a puzzled and doubting look,"
766 "which almost immediately subsided into a smile that gave me great"
766 "encouragement; for it was full of amiability and sweetness, and there"

766 "studious, pondering frost upon it was got through, very attractive and"
766 "hopeful to a young scholar like me. Repeating 'no', and 'not the least',"
766 "and other short assurances to the same purport, Doctor Strong jogged"
766 "on before us, at a queer, uneven pace; and we followed: Mr. Wickfield,"
766 "looking grave, I observed, and shaking his head to himself, without"
766 "knowing that I saw him."

766 "The schoolroom was a pretty large hall, on the quietest side of the"
766 "house, confronted by the stately stare of some half-dozen of the great"

766 "Doctor, where the peaches were ripening on the sunny south wall. There"
766 "were two great aloes, in tubs, on the turf outside the windows; the"
766 "broad hard leaves of which plant (looking as if they were made of"
766 "painted tin) have ever since, by association, been symbolical to me"
766 "of silence and retirement. About five-and-twenty boys were studiously"
766 "engaged at their books when we went in, but they rose to give the Doctor"
766 "good morning, and remained standing when they saw Mr. Wickfield and me."

766 "he was very affable and good-humoured; and he showed me my place, and"

766 "It seemed to me so long, however, since I had been among such boys,"
766 "or among any companions of my own age, except Mick Walker and Mealy"
766 "Potatoes, that I felt as strange as ever I have done in my life. I was"
766 "so conscious of having passed through scenes of which they could have"
766 "no knowledge, and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age,"
766 "appearance, and condition as one of them, that I half believed it was an"
766 "imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy. I had become,"
766 "in the Murdstone and Grinby time, however short or long it may have"
766 "been, so unused to the sports and games of boys, that I knew I was"
766 "awkward and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them."
766 "Whatever I had learnt, had so slipped away from me in the sordid cares"
766 "of my life from day to night, that now, when I was examined about what"
766 "I knew, I knew nothing, and was put into the lowest form of the school."
766 "But, troubled as I was, by my want of boyish skill, and of book-learning"
766 "too, I was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration,"
766 "that, in what I did know, I was much farther removed from my companions"
766 "than in what I did not. My mind ran upon what they would think, if they"
766 "knew of my familiar acquaintance with the King's Bench Prison? Was there"
766 "anything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with"
766 "the Micawber family--all those pawnings, and sellings, and suppers--in"
766 "spite of myself? Suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through"
766 "Canterbury, wayworn and ragged, and should find me out? What would they"
766 "say, who made so light of money, if they could know how I had scraped my"
766 "halfpence together, for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer, or"
766 "my slices of pudding? How would it affect them, who were so innocent of"
766 "London life, and London streets, to discover how knowing I was (and was"
766 "ashamed to be) in some of the meanest phases of both? All this ran in"
766 "my head so much, on that first day at Doctor Strong's, that I felt"
766 "distrustful of my slightest look and gesture; shrunk within myself"
766 "whensoever I was approached by one of my new schoolfellows; and hurried"
766 "off the minute school was over, afraid of committing myself in my"

766 "'Mama has been dead ever since I was born,' she said, in her quiet way."
766 "'I only know her picture, downstairs. I saw you looking at it yesterday."

766 ""
766 "I told her yes, because it was so like herself."

766 "gentlest of men."
766 ""
766 "'There may be some, perhaps--I don't know that there are--who abuse"
766 "his kindness,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'Never be one of those, Trotwood, in"
766 "anything. He is the least suspicious of mankind; and whether that's"
766 "a merit, or whether it's a blemish, it deserves consideration in all"
766 "dealings with the Doctor, great or small.'"
766 ""
766 "He spoke, I thought, as if he were weary, or dissatisfied with"
766 "something; but I did not pursue the question in my mind, for dinner was"
766 "just then announced, and we went down and took the same seats as before."
766 ""
766 "We had scarcely done so, when Uriah Heep put in his red head and his"

766 ""
766 "'I am but this moment quit of Mr. Maldon,' said his master."
766 ""

766 "As he held the door open with his hand, Uriah looked at me, and looked"
766 "at Agnes, and looked at the dishes, and looked at the plates, and looked"
766 "at every object in the room, I thought,--yet seemed to look at nothing;"
766 "he made such an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes"
766 "dutifully on his master. 'I beg your pardon. It's only to say, on"
766 "reflection,' observed a voice behind Uriah, as Uriah's head was"
766 "pushed away, and the speaker's substituted--'pray excuse me for this"
766 "intrusion--that as it seems I have no choice in the matter, the sooner"
766 "I go abroad the better. My cousin Annie did say, when we talked of it,"
766 "that she liked to have her friends within reach rather than to have them"
766 "banished, and the old Doctor--'"
766 ""
766 "'Doctor Strong, was that?' Mr. Wickfield interposed, gravely."

766 "'I don't know,' returned Mr. Wickfield."
766 ""
766 "'Well, Doctor Strong,' said the other--'Doctor Strong was of the same"
766 "mind, I believed. But as it appears from the course you take with me he"
766 "has changed his mind, why there's no more to be said, except that the"
766 "sooner I am off, the better. Therefore, I thought I'd come back and say,"
766 "that the sooner I am off the better. When a plunge is to be made into"
766 "the water, it's of no use lingering on the bank.'"
766 ""
766 "'There shall be as little lingering as possible, in your case, Mr."
766 "Maldon, you may depend upon it,' said Mr. Wickfield."
766 ""
766 "'Thank'ee,' said the other. 'Much obliged. I don't want to look a"
766 "gift-horse in the mouth, which is not a gracious thing to do; otherwise,"
766 "I dare say, my cousin Annie could easily arrange it in her own way. I"
766 "suppose Annie would only have to say to the old Doctor--'"
766 ""
766 "'Meaning that Mrs. Strong would only have to say to her husband--do I"
766 "follow you?' said Mr. Wickfield."
766 ""
766 "'Quite so,' returned the other, '--would only have to say, that she"
766 "wanted such and such a thing to be so and so; and it would be so and so,"

766 "'And why as a matter of course, Mr. Maldon?' asked Mr. Wickfield,"
766 "sedately eating his dinner."

766 "'Why, because Annie's a charming young girl, and the old Doctor--Doctor"
766 "Strong, I mean--is not quite a charming young boy,' said Mr. Jack"
766 "Maldon, laughing. 'No offence to anybody, Mr. Wickfield. I only mean"
766 "that I suppose some compensation is fair and reasonable in that sort of"
766 "marriage.'"
766 ""
766 "'Compensation to the lady, sir?' asked Mr. Wickfield gravely."

766 "'To the lady, sir,' Mr. Jack Maldon answered, laughing. But appearing"
766 "to remark that Mr. Wickfield went on with his dinner in the same sedate,"
766 "immovable manner, and that there was no hope of making him relax a"
766 "muscle of his face, he added: 'However, I have said what I came to say,"
766 "and, with another apology for this intrusion, I may take myself off. Of"
766 "course I shall observe your directions, in considering the matter as one"
766 "to be arranged between you and me solely, and not to be referred to, up"
766 "at the Doctor's.'"

766 "Mr. Wickfield, without rising, looked after him thoughtfully as he went"
766 "out. He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman, I thought, with"
766 "a handsome face, a rapid utterance, and a confident, bold air. And this"
766 "was the first I ever saw of Mr. Jack Maldon; whom I had not expected to"
766 "see so soon, when I heard the Doctor speak of him that morning."
766 ""
766 "When we had dined, we went upstairs again, where everything went on"
766 "exactly as on the previous day. Agnes set the glasses and decanters in"
766 "the same corner, and Mr. Wickfield sat down to drink, and drank a good"
766 "deal. Agnes played the piano to him, sat by him, and worked and talked,"
766 "and played some games at dominoes with me. In good time she made tea;"
766 "and afterwards, when I brought down my books, looked into them, and"
766 "showed me what she knew of them (which was no slight matter, though she"
766 "said it was), and what was the best way to learn and understand them."
766 "I see her, with her modest, orderly, placid manner, and I hear her"
766 "beautiful calm voice, as I write these words. The influence for all"
766 "good, which she came to exercise over me at a later time, begins"
766 "already to descend upon my breast. I love little Em'ly, and I don't love"
766 "Agnes--no, not at all in that way--but I feel that there are goodness,"
766 "peace, and truth, wherever Agnes is; and that the soft light of the"
766 "coloured window in the church, seen long ago, falls on her always, and"
766 "on me when I am near her, and on everything around."
766 ""
766 "The time having come for her withdrawal for the night, and she having"
766 "left us, I gave Mr. Wickfield my hand, preparatory to going away myself."

766 "or to go elsewhere?'"
766 ""
766 "'To stay,' I answered, quickly."
766 ""
766 "'You are sure?'"

766 ""
766 "'Than Agnes,' he repeated, walking slowly to the great chimney-piece,"
766 "and leaning against it. 'Than Agnes!'"
766 ""
766 "He had drank wine that evening (or I fancied it), until his eyes were"
766 "bloodshot. Not that I could see them now, for they were cast down, and"
766 "shaded by his hand; but I had noticed them a little while before."
766 ""
766 "'Now I wonder,' he muttered, 'whether my Agnes tires of me. When should"
766 "I ever tire of her! But that's different, that's quite different.'"
766 ""
766 "He was musing, not speaking to me; so I remained quiet."
766 ""
766 "'A dull old house,' he said, 'and a monotonous life; but I must have"
766 "her near me. I must keep her near me. If the thought that I may die and"
766 "leave my darling, or that my darling may die and leave me, comes like a"
766 "spectre, to distress my happiest hours, and is only to be drowned in--'"
766 ""
766 "He did not supply the word; but pacing slowly to the place where he had"
766 "sat, and mechanically going through the action of pouring wine from the"
766 "empty decanter, set it down and paced back again."
766 ""
766 "'If it is miserable to bear, when she is here,' he said, 'what would it"
766 "be, and she away? No, no, no. I cannot try that.'"
766 ""

766 "decide whether to run the risk of disturbing him by going, or to remain"
766 "quietly where I was, until he should come out of his reverie. At length"
766 "he aroused himself, and looked about the room until his eyes encountered"
766 "mine."
766 ""
766 "'Stay with us, Trotwood, eh?' he said in his usual manner, and as if"
766 "he were answering something I had just said. 'I am glad of it. You are"
766 "company to us both. It is wholesome to have you here. Wholesome for me,"
766 "wholesome for Agnes, wholesome perhaps for all of us.'"
766 ""
766 "'I am sure it is for me, sir,' I said. 'I am so glad to be here.'"
766 ""
766 "'That's a fine fellow!' said Mr. Wickfield. 'As long as you are glad"
766 "to be here, you shall stay here.' He shook hands with me upon it, and"
766 "clapped me on the back; and told me that when I had anything to do"
766 "at night after Agnes had left us, or when I wished to read for my own"
766 "pleasure, I was free to come down to his room, if he were there and if"
766 "I desired it for company's sake, and to sit with him. I thanked him for"
766 "his consideration; and, as he went down soon afterwards, and I was"
766 "not tired, went down too, with a book in my hand, to avail myself, for"
766 "half-an-hour, of his permission."
766 ""
766 "But, seeing a light in the little round office, and immediately feeling"
766 "myself attracted towards Uriah Heep, who had a sort of fascination for"
766 "me, I went in there instead. I found Uriah reading a great fat book,"
766 "with such demonstrative attention, that his lank forefinger followed up"
766 "every line as he read, and made clammy tracks along the page (or so I"
766 "fully believed) like a snail."
766 ""
766 "'You are working late tonight, Uriah,' says I."
766 ""
766 "'Yes, Master Copperfield,' says Uriah."

766 "As I was getting on the stool opposite, to talk to him more"
766 "conveniently, I observed that he had not such a thing as a smile about"
766 "him, and that he could only widen his mouth and make two hard creases"
766 "down his cheeks, one on each side, to stand for one."
766 ""
766 "'I am not doing office-work, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah."
766 ""
766 "'What work, then?' I asked."
766 ""
766 "'I am improving my legal knowledge, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah. 'I"
766 "am going through Tidd's Practice. Oh, what a writer Mr. Tidd is, Master"
766 "Copperfield!'"
766 ""
766 "My stool was such a tower of observation, that as I watched him reading"
766 "on again, after this rapturous exclamation, and following up the lines"
766 "with his forefinger, I observed that his nostrils, which were thin and"
766 "pointed, with sharp dints in them, had a singular and most uncomfortable"
766 "way of expanding and contracting themselves--that they seemed to twinkle"
766 "instead of his eyes, which hardly ever twinkled at all."
766 ""
766 "'I suppose you are quite a great lawyer?' I said, after looking at him"
766 "for some time."
766 ""
766 "'Me, Master Copperfield?' said Uriah. 'Oh, no! I'm a very umble person.'"
766 ""
766 "It was no fancy of mine about his hands, I observed; for he frequently"
766 "ground the palms against each other as if to squeeze them dry and"
766 "warm, besides often wiping them, in a stealthy way, on his"
766 "pocket-handkerchief."
766 ""
766 "'I am well aware that I am the umblest person going,' said Uriah Heep,"
766 "modestly; 'let the other be where he may. My mother is likewise a very"
766 "umble person. We live in a numble abode, Master Copperfield, but have"
766 "much to be thankful for. My father's former calling was umble. He was a"
766 "sexton.'"
766 ""
766 "'What is he now?' I asked."
766 ""
766 "'He is a partaker of glory at present, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah"
766 "Heep. 'But we have much to be thankful for. How much have I to be"
766 "thankful for in living with Mr. Wickfield!'"
766 ""
766 "I asked Uriah if he had been with Mr. Wickfield long?"
766 ""
766 "'I have been with him, going on four year, Master Copperfield,' said"
766 "Uriah; shutting up his book, after carefully marking the place where he"
766 "had left off. 'Since a year after my father's death. How much have I"
766 "to be thankful for, in that! How much have I to be thankful for, in Mr."
766 "Wickfield's kind intention to give me my articles, which would otherwise"
766 "not lay within the umble means of mother and self!'"
766 ""
766 "'Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, I"
766 "suppose?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'With the blessing of Providence, Master Copperfield,' returned Uriah."
766 ""
766 "'Perhaps you'll be a partner in Mr. Wickfield's business, one of these"
766 "days,' I said, to make myself agreeable; 'and it will be Wickfield and"
766 "Heep, or Heep late Wickfield.'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh no, Master Copperfield,' returned Uriah, shaking his head, 'I am"
766 "much too umble for that!'"

766 "He certainly did look uncommonly like the carved face on the beam"
766 "outside my window, as he sat, in his humility, eyeing me sideways, with"
766 "his mouth widened, and the creases in his cheeks."
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Wickfield is a most excellent man, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah."

766 "'Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah. 'Your aunt is a sweet"
766 "lady, Master Copperfield!'"
766 ""
766 "He had a way of writhing when he wanted to express enthusiasm, which was"
766 "very ugly; and which diverted my attention from the compliment he had"
766 "paid my relation, to the snaky twistings of his throat and body."
766 ""
766 "'A sweet lady, Master Copperfield!' said Uriah Heep. 'She has a great"
766 "admiration for Miss Agnes, Master Copperfield, I believe?'"

766 "excitement of his feelings, and, being off, began to make arrangements"
766 "for going home."
766 ""
766 "'Mother will be expecting me,' he said, referring to a pale,"
766 "inexpressive-faced watch in his pocket, 'and getting uneasy; for though"
766 "we are very umble, Master Copperfield, we are much attached to one"
766 "another. If you would come and see us, any afternoon, and take a cup of"
766 "tea at our lowly dwelling, mother would be as proud of your company as I"
766 "should be.'"
766 ""
766 "I said I should be glad to come."
766 ""

766 "away upon the shelf--'I suppose you stop here, some time, Master"
766 "Copperfield?'"
766 ""
766 "I said I was going to be brought up there, I believed, as long as I"

766 "was entertained in my behalf by anybody; but Uriah insisted on blandly"
766 "replying to all my assurances, 'Oh, yes, Master Copperfield, I should"
766 "think you would, indeed!' and, 'Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield, I should"
766 "think you would, certainly!' over and over again. Being, at last, ready"
766 "to leave the office for the night, he asked me if it would suit my"
766 "convenience to have the light put out; and on my answering 'Yes,'"
766 "instantly extinguished it. After shaking hands with me--his hand felt"
766 "like a fish, in the dark--he opened the door into the street a very"
766 "little, and crept out, and shut it, leaving me to grope my way back into"
766 "the house: which cost me some trouble and a fall over his stool. This"
766 "was the proximate cause, I suppose, of my dreaming about him, for what"
766 "appeared to me to be half the night; and dreaming, among other things,"
766 "that he had launched Mr. Peggotty's house on a piratical expedition,"
766 "with a black flag at the masthead, bearing the inscription 'Tidd's"
766 "Practice', under which diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little"
766 "Em'ly to the Spanish Main, to be drowned."

766 "I got a little the better of my uneasiness when I went to school"
766 "next day, and a good deal the better next day, and so shook it off by"
766 "degrees, that in less than a fortnight I was quite at home, and happy,"
766 "among my new companions. I was awkward enough in their games, and"
766 "backward enough in their studies; but custom would improve me in the"
766 "first respect, I hoped, and hard work in the second. Accordingly, I"
766 "went to work very hard, both in play and in earnest, and gained great"
766 "commendation. And, in a very little while, the Murdstone and Grinby life"
766 "became so strange to me that I hardly believed in it, while my present"
766 "life grew so familiar, that I seemed to have been leading it a long"
766 "time."

766 "Doctor Strong's was an excellent school; as different from Mr. Creakle's"
766 "as good is from evil. It was very gravely and decorously ordered, and"
766 "on a sound system; with an appeal, in everything, to the honour and good"
766 "faith of the boys, and an avowed intention to rely on their possession"
766 "of those qualities unless they proved themselves unworthy of it, which"
766 "worked wonders. We all felt that we had a part in the management of"
766 "the place, and in sustaining its character and dignity. Hence, we soon"
766 "became warmly attached to it--I am sure I did for one, and I never knew,"
766 "in all my time, of any other boy being otherwise--and learnt with a good"
766 "will, desiring to do it credit. We had noble games out of hours, and"
766 "plenty of liberty; but even then, as I remember, we were well spoken of"
766 "in the town, and rarely did any disgrace, by our appearance or manner,"
766 "to the reputation of Doctor Strong and Doctor Strong's boys."
766 ""
766 "Some of the higher scholars boarded in the Doctor's house, and through"
766 "them I learned, at second hand, some particulars of the Doctor's"
766 "history--as, how he had not yet been married twelve months to the"
766 "beautiful young lady I had seen in the study, whom he had married for"
766 "love; for she had not a sixpence, and had a world of poor relations (so"
766 "our fellows said) ready to swarm the Doctor out of house and home. Also,"
766 "how the Doctor's cogitating manner was attributable to his being always"
766 "engaged in looking out for Greek roots; which, in my innocence and"
766 "ignorance, I supposed to be a botanical furor on the Doctor's part,"
766 "especially as he always looked at the ground when he walked about,"
766 "until I understood that they were roots of words, with a view to a new"
766 "Dictionary which he had in contemplation. Adams, our head-boy, who had"
766 "a turn for mathematics, had made a calculation, I was informed, of the"
766 "time this Dictionary would take in completing, on the Doctor's plan, and"
766 "at the Doctor's rate of going. He considered that it might be done"

766 "But the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school: and it must"

766 "touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall. As he walked up"
766 "and down that part of the courtyard which was at the side of the house,"
766 "with the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with their heads"
766 "cocked slyly, as if they knew how much more knowing they were in worldly"
766 "affairs than he, if any sort of vagabond could only get near enough to"
766 "his creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale"
766 "of distress, that vagabond was made for the next two days. It was so"
766 "notorious in the house, that the masters and head-boys took pains to cut"
766 "these marauders off at angles, and to get out of windows, and turn them"
766 "out of the courtyard, before they could make the Doctor aware of their"
766 "presence; which was sometimes happily effected within a few yards of"
766 "him, without his knowing anything of the matter, as he jogged to and"
766 "fro. Outside his own domain, and unprotected, he was a very sheep for"
766 "the shearers. He would have taken his gaiters off his legs, to give"
766 "away. In fact, there was a story current among us (I have no idea, and"
766 "never had, on what authority, but I have believed it for so many"
766 "years that I feel quite certain it is true), that on a frosty day, one"
766 "winter-time, he actually did bestow his gaiters on a beggar-woman, who"
766 "occasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant"
766 "from door to door, wrapped in those garments, which were universally"
766 "recognized, being as well known in the vicinity as the Cathedral. The"
766 "legend added that the only person who did not identify them was the"
766 "Doctor himself, who, when they were shortly afterwards displayed at the"
766 "door of a little second-hand shop of no very good repute, where such"
766 "things were taken in exchange for gin, was more than once observed to"

766 "afterwards kind to me, and interested in me; and because she was very"
766 "fond of Agnes, and was often backwards and forwards at our house. There"
766 "was a curious constraint between her and Mr. Wickfield, I thought (of"
766 "whom she seemed to be afraid), that never wore off. When she came there"
766 "of an evening, she always shrunk from accepting his escort home, and ran"
766 "away with me instead. And sometimes, as we were running gaily across"
766 "the Cathedral yard together, expecting to meet nobody, we would meet Mr."
766 "Jack Maldon, who was always surprised to see us."

766 "Mrs. Strong's mama was a lady I took great delight in. Her name was Mrs."

766 "her generalship, and the skill with which she marshalled great forces"
766 "of relations against the Doctor. She was a little, sharp-eyed woman,"
766 "who used to wear, when she was dressed, one unchangeable cap, ornamented"
766 "with some artificial flowers, and two artificial butterflies supposed"
766 "to be hovering above the flowers. There was a superstition among us"
766 "that this cap had come from France, and could only originate in the"
766 "workmanship of that ingenious nation: but all I certainly know about it,"
766 "is, that it always made its appearance of an evening, wheresoever Mrs."
766 "Markleham made HER appearance; that it was carried about to friendly"
766 "meetings in a Hindoo basket; that the butterflies had the gift of"
766 "trembling constantly; and that they improved the shining hours at Doctor"
766 "Strong's expense, like busy bees."

766 "I observed the Old Soldier--not to adopt the name disrespectfully--to"
766 "pretty good advantage, on a night which is made memorable to me by"

766 "Doctor's, which was given on the occasion of Mr. Jack Maldon's departure"
766 "for India, whither he was going as a cadet, or something of that kind:"
766 "Mr. Wickfield having at length arranged the business. It happened to be"
766 "the Doctor's birthday, too. We had had a holiday, had made presents to"
766 "him in the morning, had made a speech to him through the head-boy, and"
766 "had cheered him until we were hoarse, and until he had shed tears. And"

766 "Mr. Jack Maldon was there, before us. Mrs. Strong, dressed in white,"
766 "with cherry-coloured ribbons, was playing the piano, when we went in;"
766 "and he was leaning over her to turn the leaves. The clear red and"
766 "white of her complexion was not so blooming and flower-like as usual, I"

766 "proposing for Annie. Not that there was anything so very much out of"
766 "the way, in the mere fact of the proposal--it would be ridiculous to say"
766 "that!--but because, you having known her poor father, and having known"
766 "her from a baby six months old, I hadn't thought of you in such a light"
766 "at all, or indeed as a marrying man in any way,--simply that, you know.'"
766 ""

766 "mind very much. I recall these things that I may be contradicted if I am"
766 "wrong. Well! Then I spoke to Annie, and I told her what had happened."
766 "I said, \"My dear, here's Doctor Strong has positively been and made you"
766 "the subject of a handsome declaration and an offer.\" Did I press it in"
766 "the least? No. I said, \"Now, Annie, tell me the truth this moment; is"
766 "your heart free?\" \"Mama,\" she said crying, \"I am extremely young\"--which"
766 "was perfectly true--\"and I hardly know if I have a heart at all.\" \"Then,"
766 "my dear,\" I said, \"you may rely upon it, it's free. At all events, my"

766 "on further investigation that this was so, or at least there was an"
766 "agreement between him and my aunt that he should account to her for"
766 "all his disbursements. As he had no idea of deceiving her, and always"

766 "I seen him mounted on a little knoll, cheering the whole field on"
766 "to action, and waving his hat above his grey head, oblivious of King"
766 "Charles the Martyr's head, and all belonging to it! How many a"
766 "summer hour have I known to be but blissful minutes to him in"
766 "the cricket-field! How many winter days have I seen him, standing"

766 "He could turn cramp-bones into chessmen; fashion Roman chariots from old"
766 "court cards; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels, and bird-cages of"

766 "abased themselves before him, Mr. Micawber took a seat, and waved his"
766 "hand in his most courtly manner."
766 ""
766 "'Any friend of my friend Copperfield's,' said Mr. Micawber, 'has a"
766 "personal claim upon myself.'"
766 ""
766 "'We are too umble, sir,' said Mrs. Heep, 'my son and me, to be the"
766 "friends of Master Copperfield. He has been so good as take his tea with"
766 "us, and we are thankful to him for his company, also to you, sir, for"
766 "your notice.'"
766 ""
766 "'Ma'am,' returned Mr. Micawber, with a bow, 'you are very obliging: and"
766 "what are you doing, Copperfield? Still in the wine trade?'"
766 ""
766 "I was excessively anxious to get Mr. Micawber away; and replied, with my"
766 "hat in my hand, and a very red face, I have no doubt, that I was a pupil"
766 "at Doctor Strong's."
766 ""
766 "'A pupil?' said Mr. Micawber, raising his eyebrows. 'I am extremely"
766 "happy to hear it. Although a mind like my friend Copperfield's'--to"
766 "Uriah and Mrs. Heep--'does not require that cultivation which, without"
766 "his knowledge of men and things, it would require, still it is a rich"
766 "soil teeming with latent vegetation--in short,' said Mr. Micawber,"
766 "smiling, in another burst of confidence, 'it is an intellect capable of"
766 "getting up the classics to any extent.'"
766 ""
766 "Uriah, with his long hands slowly twining over one another, made a"
766 "ghastly writhe from the waist upwards, to express his concurrence in"
766 "this estimation of me."
766 ""
766 "'Shall we go and see Mrs. Micawber, sir?' I said, to get Mr. Micawber"
766 "away."
766 ""
766 "'If you will do her that favour, Copperfield,' replied Mr. Micawber,"
766 "rising. 'I have no scruple in saying, in the presence of our friends"
766 "here, that I am a man who has, for some years, contended against the"
766 "pressure of pecuniary difficulties.' I knew he was certain to say"
766 "something of this kind; he always would be so boastful about his"
766 "difficulties. 'Sometimes I have risen superior to my difficulties."
766 "Sometimes my difficulties have--in short, have floored me. There have"
766 "been times when I have administered a succession of facers to them;"
766 "there have been times when they have been too many for me, and I have"
766 "given in, and said to Mrs. Micawber, in the words of Cato, \"Plato, thou"
766 "reasonest well. It's all up now. I can show fight no more.\" But at no"
766 "time of my life,' said Mr. Micawber, 'have I enjoyed a higher degree of"
766 "satisfaction than in pouring my griefs (if I may describe difficulties,"
766 "chiefly arising out of warrants of attorney and promissory notes at two"
766 "and four months, by that word) into the bosom of my friend Copperfield.'"
766 ""
766 "Mr. Micawber closed this handsome tribute by saying, 'Mr. Heep! Good"
766 "evening. Mrs. Heep! Your servant,' and then walking out with me in his"
766 "most fashionable manner, making a good deal of noise on the pavement"
766 "with his shoes, and humming a tune as we went."
766 ""
766 "It was a little inn where Mr. Micawber put up, and he occupied a little"
766 "room in it, partitioned off from the commercial room, and strongly"
766 "flavoured with tobacco-smoke. I think it was over the kitchen, because"
766 "a warm greasy smell appeared to come up through the chinks in the floor,"
766 "and there was a flabby perspiration on the walls. I know it was near the"
766 "bar, on account of the smell of spirits and jingling of glasses. Here,"
766 "recumbent on a small sofa, underneath a picture of a race-horse, with"
766 "her head close to the fire, and her feet pushing the mustard off the"
766 "dumb-waiter at the other end of the room, was Mrs. Micawber, to whom Mr."
766 "Micawber entered first, saying, 'My dear, allow me to introduce to you a"
766 "pupil of Doctor Strong's.'"
766 ""
766 "I noticed, by the by, that although Mr. Micawber was just as much"
766 "confused as ever about my age and standing, he always remembered, as a"
766 "genteel thing, that I was a pupil of Doctor Strong's."
766 ""
766 "Mrs. Micawber was amazed, but very glad to see me. I was very glad to"
766 "see her too, and, after an affectionate greeting on both sides, sat down"
766 "on the small sofa near her."
766 ""
766 "'My dear,' said Mr. Micawber, 'if you will mention to Copperfield what"
766 "our present position is, which I have no doubt he will like to know, I"
766 "will go and look at the paper the while, and see whether anything turns"
766 "up among the advertisements.'"
766 ""
766 "'I thought you were at Plymouth, ma'am,' I said to Mrs. Micawber, as he"
766 "went out."
766 ""
766 "'My dear Master Copperfield,' she replied, 'we went to Plymouth.'"
766 ""
766 "'To be on the spot,' I hinted."
766 ""
766 "'Just so,' said Mrs. Micawber. 'To be on the spot. But, the truth is,"
766 "talent is not wanted in the Custom House. The local influence of my"
766 "family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department,"
766 "for a man of Mr. Micawber's abilities. They would rather NOT have a man"
766 "of Mr. Micawber's abilities. He would only show the deficiency of the"
766 "others. Apart from which,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'I will not disguise"
766 "from you, my dear Master Copperfield, that when that branch of my"
766 "family which is settled in Plymouth, became aware that Mr. Micawber was"
766 "accompanied by myself, and by little Wilkins and his sister, and by the"
766 "twins, they did not receive him with that ardour which he might have"
766 "expected, being so newly released from captivity. In fact,' said Mrs."
766 "Micawber, lowering her voice,--'this is between ourselves--our reception"
766 "was cool.'"
766 ""
766 "'Dear me!' I said."
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' said Mrs. Micawber. 'It is truly painful to contemplate mankind"
766 "in such an aspect, Master Copperfield, but our reception was, decidedly,"
766 "cool. There is no doubt about it. In fact, that branch of my family"
766 "which is settled in Plymouth became quite personal to Mr. Micawber,"
766 "before we had been there a week.'"
766 ""
766 "I said, and thought, that they ought to be ashamed of themselves."
766 ""
766 "'Still, so it was,' continued Mrs. Micawber. 'Under such circumstances,"
766 "what could a man of Mr. Micawber's spirit do? But one obvious course"
766 "was left. To borrow, of that branch of my family, the money to return to"
766 "London, and to return at any sacrifice.'"
766 ""
766 "'Then you all came back again, ma'am?' I said."
766 ""
766 "'We all came back again,' replied Mrs. Micawber. 'Since then, I have"
766 "consulted other branches of my family on the course which it is most"
766 "expedient for Mr. Micawber to take--for I maintain that he must take"
766 "some course, Master Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, argumentatively."
766 "'It is clear that a family of six, not including a domestic, cannot live"
766 "upon air.'"
766 ""
766 "'Certainly, ma'am,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'The opinion of those other branches of my family,' pursued Mrs."
766 "Micawber, 'is, that Mr. Micawber should immediately turn his attention"
766 "to coals.'"
766 ""
766 "'To what, ma'am?'"
766 ""
766 "'To coals,' said Mrs. Micawber. 'To the coal trade. Mr. Micawber was"
766 "induced to think, on inquiry, that there might be an opening for a"
766 "man of his talent in the Medway Coal Trade. Then, as Mr. Micawber very"
766 "properly said, the first step to be taken clearly was, to come and see"
766 "the Medway. Which we came and saw. I say \"we\", Master Copperfield; for"
766 "I never will,' said Mrs. Micawber with emotion, 'I never will desert Mr."
766 "Micawber.'"
766 ""
766 "I murmured my admiration and approbation."
766 ""
766 "'We came,' repeated Mrs. Micawber, 'and saw the Medway. My opinion of"
766 "the coal trade on that river is, that it may require talent, but that"
766 "it certainly requires capital. Talent, Mr. Micawber has; capital, Mr."
766 "Micawber has not. We saw, I think, the greater part of the Medway; and"
766 "that is my individual conclusion. Being so near here, Mr. Micawber was"
766 "of opinion that it would be rash not to come on, and see the Cathedral."
766 "Firstly, on account of its being so well worth seeing, and our never"
766 "having seen it; and secondly, on account of the great probability of"
766 "something turning up in a cathedral town. We have been here,' said Mrs."
766 "Micawber, 'three days. Nothing has, as yet, turned up; and it may"
766 "not surprise you, my dear Master Copperfield, so much as it would a"
766 "stranger, to know that we are at present waiting for a remittance from"
766 "London, to discharge our pecuniary obligations at this hotel. Until the"
766 "arrival of that remittance,' said Mrs. Micawber with much feeling, 'I am"
766 "cut off from my home (I allude to lodgings in Pentonville), from my boy"
766 "and girl, and from my twins.'"
766 ""
766 "I felt the utmost sympathy for Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in this anxious"
766 "extremity, and said as much to Mr. Micawber, who now returned: adding"
766 "that I only wished I had money enough, to lend them the amount they"
766 "needed. Mr. Micawber's answer expressed the disturbance of his mind. He"
766 "said, shaking hands with me, 'Copperfield, you are a true friend; but"
766 "when the worst comes to the worst, no man is without a friend who is"
766 "possessed of shaving materials.' At this dreadful hint Mrs. Micawber"
766 "threw her arms round Mr. Micawber's neck and entreated him to be calm."
766 "He wept; but so far recovered, almost immediately, as to ring the bell"
766 "for the waiter, and bespeak a hot kidney pudding and a plate of shrimps"
766 "for breakfast in the morning."
766 ""
766 "When I took my leave of them, they both pressed me so much to come and"
766 "dine before they went away, that I could not refuse. But, as I knew I"
766 "could not come next day, when I should have a good deal to prepare in"
766 "the evening, Mr. Micawber arranged that he would call at Doctor Strong's"
766 "in the course of the morning (having a presentiment that the remittance"
766 "would arrive by that post), and propose the day after, if it would suit"
766 "me better. Accordingly I was called out of school next forenoon, and"
766 "found Mr. Micawber in the parlour; who had called to say that the dinner"
766 "would take place as proposed. When I asked him if the remittance had"
766 "come, he pressed my hand and departed."
766 ""
766 "As I was looking out of window that same evening, it surprised me, and"
766 "made me rather uneasy, to see Mr. Micawber and Uriah Heep walk past, arm"
766 "in arm: Uriah humbly sensible of the honour that was done him, and Mr."
766 "Micawber taking a bland delight in extending his patronage to Uriah. But"
766 "I was still more surprised, when I went to the little hotel next day at"
766 "the appointed dinner-hour, which was four o'clock, to find, from what"
766 "Mr. Micawber said, that he had gone home with Uriah, and had drunk"
766 "brandy-and-water at Mrs. Heep's."
766 ""
766 "'And I'll tell you what, my dear Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, 'your"
766 "friend Heep is a young fellow who might be attorney-general. If I had"
766 "known that young man, at the period when my difficulties came to a"
766 "crisis, all I can say is, that I believe my creditors would have been a"
766 "great deal better managed than they were.'"
766 ""
766 "I hardly understood how this could have been, seeing that Mr. Micawber"
766 "had paid them nothing at all as it was; but I did not like to"
766 "ask. Neither did I like to say, that I hoped he had not been too"
766 "communicative to Uriah; or to inquire if they had talked much about me."
766 "I was afraid of hurting Mr. Micawber's feelings, or, at all events, Mrs."
766 "Micawber's, she being very sensitive; but I was uncomfortable about it,"
766 "too, and often thought about it afterwards."
766 ""
766 "We had a beautiful little dinner. Quite an elegant dish of fish; the"
766 "kidney-end of a loin of veal, roasted; fried sausage-meat; a partridge,"
766 "and a pudding. There was wine, and there was strong ale; and after"
766 "dinner Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Micawber was uncommonly convivial. I never saw him such good"
766 "company. He made his face shine with the punch, so that it looked as if"
766 "it had been varnished all over. He got cheerfully sentimental about"
766 "the town, and proposed success to it; observing that Mrs. Micawber and"
766 "himself had been made extremely snug and comfortable there and that he"
766 "never should forget the agreeable hours they had passed in Canterbury."
766 "He proposed me afterwards; and he, and Mrs. Micawber, and I, took a"
766 "review of our past acquaintance, in the course of which we sold the"
766 "property all over again. Then I proposed Mrs. Micawber: or, at least,"
766 "said, modestly, 'If you'll allow me, Mrs. Micawber, I shall now have"
766 "the pleasure of drinking your health, ma'am.' On which Mr. Micawber"
766 "delivered an eulogium on Mrs. Micawber's character, and said she"
766 "had ever been his guide, philosopher, and friend, and that he would"
766 "recommend me, when I came to a marrying time of life, to marry such"
766 "another woman, if such another woman could be found."
766 ""
766 "As the punch disappeared, Mr. Micawber became still more friendly and"
766 "convivial. Mrs. Micawber's spirits becoming elevated, too, we sang 'Auld"
766 "Lang Syne'. When we came to 'Here's a hand, my trusty frere', we all"
766 "joined hands round the table; and when we declared we would 'take a"
766 "right gude Willie Waught', and hadn't the least idea what it meant, we"
766 "were really affected."

766 "In a word, I never saw anybody so thoroughly jovial as Mr. Micawber"
766 "was, down to the very last moment of the evening, when I took a hearty"
766 "farewell of himself and his amiable wife. Consequently, I was not"

766 "endure, humiliating to contemplate, and humiliating to relate, I have"
766 "discharged the pecuniary liability contracted at this establishment,"
766 "by giving a note of hand, made payable fourteen days after date, at"
766 "my residence, Pentonville, London. When it becomes due, it will not be"

766 "in my inmost thoughts, and to let no harsh construction find any place"
766 "against him; she was, at once, so proud of him and devoted to him, yet"

766 "going to China, received me as an honoured guest; and called for a log"

766 "The Doctor was very fond of music. Agnes sang with great sweetness and"
766 "expression, and so did Mrs. Strong. They sang together, and played duets"
766 "together, and we had quite a little concert. But I remarked two things:"
766 "first, that though Annie soon recovered her composure, and was quite"
766 "herself, there was a blank between her and Mr. Wickfield which separated"
766 "them wholly from each other; secondly, that Mr. Wickfield seemed"
766 "to dislike the intimacy between her and Agnes, and to watch it with"
766 "uneasiness. And now, I must confess, the recollection of what I had seen"
766 "on that night when Mr. Maldon went away, first began to return upon me"
766 "with a meaning it had never had, and to trouble me. The innocent beauty"
766 "of her face was not as innocent to me as it had been; I mistrusted the"
766 "natural grace and charm of her manner; and when I looked at Agnes by her"
766 "side, and thought how good and true Agnes was, suspicions arose within"
766 "me that it was an ill-assorted friendship."

766 "She was so happy in it herself, however, and the other was so happy too,"

766 "other, and Agnes was going to embrace her and kiss her, when Mr."
766 "Wickfield stepped between them, as if by accident, and drew Agnes"
766 "quickly away. Then I saw, as though all the intervening time had been"
766 "cancelled, and I were still standing in the doorway on the night of the"
766 "departure, the expression of that night in the face of Mrs. Strong, as"
766 "it confronted his."

766 "I cannot say what an impression this made upon me, or how impossible I"

766 "look, and remember her face in its innocent loveliness again. It haunted"
766 "me when I got home. I seemed to have left the Doctor's roof with a dark"
766 "cloud lowering on it. The reverence that I had for his grey head, was"
766 "mingled with commiseration for his faith in those who were treacherous"
766 "to him, and with resentment against those who injured him. The impending"
766 "shadow of a great affliction, and a great disgrace that had no distinct"
766 "form in it yet, fell like a stain upon the quiet place where I had"
766 "worked and played as a boy, and did it a cruel wrong. I had no pleasure"
766 "in thinking, any more, of the grave old broad-leaved aloe-trees, which"
766 "remained shut up in themselves a hundred years together, and of the trim"
766 "smooth grass-plot, and the stone urns, and the Doctor's walk, and the"
766 "congenial sound of the Cathedral bell hovering above them all. It was as"
766 "if the tranquil sanctuary of my boyhood had been sacked before my face,"
766 "and its peace and honour given to the winds."

766 "But morning brought with it my parting from the old house, which Agnes"

766 "I should be there again soon, no doubt; I might sleep again--perhaps"
766 "often--in my old room; but the days of my inhabiting there were gone,"

766 ""
766 "At another time I might have wanted the confidence or the decision to"
766 "speak to him, and might have put it off until next day, and might have"
766 "lost him. But, in the then condition of my mind, where the play was"
766 "still running high, his former protection of me appeared so deserving"
766 "of my gratitude, and my old love for him overflowed my breast so freshly"
766 "and spontaneously, that I went up to him at once, with a fast-beating"
766 "heart, and said:"
766 ""
766 "'Steerforth! won't you speak to me?'"
766 ""
766 "He looked at me--just as he used to look, sometimes--but I saw no"
766 "recognition in his face."
766 ""
766 "'You don't remember me, I am afraid,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'My God!' he suddenly exclaimed. 'It's little Copperfield!'"
766 ""
766 "I grasped him by both hands, and could not let them go. But for very"
766 "shame, and the fear that it might displease him, I could have held him"
766 "round the neck and cried."
766 ""
766 "'I never, never, never was so glad! My dear Steerforth, I am so"
766 "overjoyed to see you!'"
766 ""
766 "'And I am rejoiced to see you, too!' he said, shaking my hands heartily."
766 "'Why, Copperfield, old boy, don't be overpowered!' And yet he was glad,"
766 "too, I thought, to see how the delight I had in meeting him affected me."
766 ""
766 "I brushed away the tears that my utmost resolution had not been able to"
766 "keep back, and I made a clumsy laugh of it, and we sat down together,"
766 "side by side."
766 ""
766 "'Why, how do you come to be here?' said Steerforth, clapping me on the"
766 "shoulder."
766 ""
766 "'I came here by the Canterbury coach, today. I have been adopted by"
766 "an aunt down in that part of the country, and have just finished my"
766 "education there. How do YOU come to be here, Steerforth?'"
766 ""
766 "'Well, I am what they call an Oxford man,' he returned; 'that is to say,"
766 "I get bored to death down there, periodically--and I am on my way now to"
766 "my mother's. You're a devilish amiable-looking fellow, Copperfield. Just"
766 "what you used to be, now I look at you! Not altered in the least!'"
766 ""
766 "'I knew you immediately,' I said; 'but you are more easily remembered.'"
766 ""
766 "He laughed as he ran his hand through the clustering curls of his hair,"
766 "and said gaily:"
766 ""
766 "'Yes, I am on an expedition of duty. My mother lives a little way out of"
766 "town; and the roads being in a beastly condition, and our house tedious"
766 "enough, I remained here tonight instead of going on. I have not been in"
766 "town half-a-dozen hours, and those I have been dozing and grumbling away"
766 "at the play.'"
766 ""
766 "'I have been at the play, too,' said I. 'At Covent Garden. What a"
766 "delightful and magnificent entertainment, Steerforth!'"
766 ""
766 "Steerforth laughed heartily."
766 ""
766 "'My dear young Davy,' he said, clapping me on the shoulder again, 'you"
766 "are a very Daisy. The daisy of the field, at sunrise, is not fresher"
766 "than you are. I have been at Covent Garden, too, and there never was a"
766 "more miserable business. Holloa, you sir!'"
766 ""
766 "This was addressed to the waiter, who had been very attentive to our"
766 "recognition, at a distance, and now came forward deferentially."
766 ""
766 "'Where have you put my friend, Mr. Copperfield?' said Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'Beg your pardon, sir?'"
766 ""
766 "'Where does he sleep? What's his number? You know what I mean,' said"
766 "Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'Well, sir,' said the waiter, with an apologetic air. 'Mr. Copperfield"
766 "is at present in forty-four, sir.'"
766 ""
766 "'And what the devil do you mean,' retorted Steerforth, 'by putting Mr."
766 "Copperfield into a little loft over a stable?'"
766 ""
766 "'Why, you see we wasn't aware, sir,' returned the waiter, still"
766 "apologetically, 'as Mr. Copperfield was anyways particular. We can give"
766 "Mr. Copperfield seventy-two, sir, if it would be preferred. Next you,"
766 "sir.'"
766 ""
766 "'Of course it would be preferred,' said Steerforth. 'And do it at once.'"
766 "The waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange. Steerforth, very"
766 "much amused at my having been put into forty-four, laughed again, and"
766 "clapped me on the shoulder again, and invited me to breakfast with him"
766 "next morning at ten o'clock--an invitation I was only too proud and"
766 "happy to accept. It being now pretty late, we took our candles and went"
766 "upstairs, where we parted with friendly heartiness at his door, and"
766 "where I found my new room a great improvement on my old one, it not"
766 "being at all musty, and having an immense four-post bedstead in it,"
766 "which was quite a little landed estate. Here, among pillows enough for"
766 "six, I soon fell asleep in a blissful condition, and dreamed of ancient"
766 "Rome, Steerforth, and friendship, until the early morning coaches,"
766 "rumbling out of the archway underneath, made me dream of thunder and the"
766 "gods."

766 "When the chambermaid tapped at my door at eight o'clock, and informed"
766 "me that my shaving-water was outside, I felt severely the having no"
766 "occasion for it, and blushed in my bed. The suspicion that she laughed"
766 "too, when she said it, preyed upon my mind all the time I was dressing;"
766 "and gave me, I was conscious, a sneaking and guilty air when I passed"
766 "her on the staircase, as I was going down to breakfast. I was so"
766 "sensitively aware, indeed, of being younger than I could have wished,"
766 "that for some time I could not make up my mind to pass her at all, under"
766 "the ignoble circumstances of the case; but, hearing her there with"
766 "a broom, stood peeping out of window at King Charles on horseback,"
766 "surrounded by a maze of hackney-coaches, and looking anything but regal"
766 "in a drizzling rain and a dark-brown fog, until I was admonished by the"
766 "waiter that the gentleman was waiting for me."
766 ""
766 "It was not in the coffee-room that I found Steerforth expecting me, but"
766 "in a snug private apartment, red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted, where"
766 "the fire burnt bright, and a fine hot breakfast was set forth on a table"
766 "covered with a clean cloth; and a cheerful miniature of the room, the"
766 "fire, the breakfast, Steerforth, and all, was shining in the little"
766 "round mirror over the sideboard. I was rather bashful at first,"
766 "Steerforth being so self-possessed, and elegant, and superior to me in"
766 "all respects (age included); but his easy patronage soon put that to"
766 "rights, and made me quite at home. I could not enough admire the change"
766 "he had wrought in the Golden Cross; or compare the dull forlorn state"
766 "I had held yesterday, with this morning's comfort and this morning's"
766 "entertainment. As to the waiter's familiarity, it was quenched as if it"
766 "had never been. He attended on us, as I may say, in sackcloth and ashes."
766 ""
766 "'Now, Copperfield,' said Steerforth, when we were alone, 'I should like"
766 "to hear what you are doing, and where you are going, and all about you."
766 "I feel as if you were my property.' Glowing with pleasure to find that"
766 "he had still this interest in me, I told him how my aunt had proposed"
766 "the little expedition that I had before me, and whither it tended."
766 ""
766 "'As you are in no hurry, then,' said Steerforth, 'come home with me to"
766 "Highgate, and stay a day or two. You will be pleased with my mother--she"
766 "is a little vain and prosy about me, but that you can forgive her--and"
766 "she will be pleased with you.'"
766 ""
766 "'I should like to be as sure of that, as you are kind enough to say you"
766 "are,' I answered, smiling."
766 ""
766 "'Oh!' said Steerforth, 'everyone who likes me, has a claim on her that"
766 "is sure to be acknowledged.'"
766 ""
766 "'Then I think I shall be a favourite,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Good!' said Steerforth. 'Come and prove it. We will go and see the"
766 "lions for an hour or two--it's something to have a fresh fellow like you"
766 "to show them to, Copperfield--and then we'll journey out to Highgate by"
766 "the coach.'"
766 ""
766 "I could hardly believe but that I was in a dream, and that I should wake"
766 "presently in number forty-four, to the solitary box in the coffee-room"
766 "and the familiar waiter again. After I had written to my aunt and told"
766 "her of my fortunate meeting with my admired old schoolfellow, and my"
766 "acceptance of his invitation, we went out in a hackney-chariot, and saw"
766 "a Panorama and some other sights, and took a walk through the Museum,"
766 "where I could not help observing how much Steerforth knew, on an"
766 "infinite variety of subjects, and of how little account he seemed to"
766 "make his knowledge."
766 ""
766 "'You'll take a high degree at college, Steerforth,' said I, 'if you have"
766 "not done so already; and they will have good reason to be proud of you.'"
766 ""
766 "'I take a degree!' cried Steerforth. 'Not I! my dear Daisy--will you"
766 "mind my calling you Daisy?'"
766 ""
766 "'Not at all!' said I."
766 ""
766 "'That's a good fellow! My dear Daisy,' said Steerforth, laughing. 'I"
766 "have not the least desire or intention to distinguish myself in that"
766 "way. I have done quite sufficient for my purpose. I find that I am heavy"
766 "company enough for myself as I am.'"
766 ""
766 "'But the fame--' I was beginning."
766 ""
766 "'You romantic Daisy!' said Steerforth, laughing still more heartily:"
766 "'why should I trouble myself, that a parcel of heavy-headed fellows may"
766 "gape and hold up their hands? Let them do it at some other man. There's"
766 "fame for him, and he's welcome to it.'"
766 ""
766 "I was abashed at having made so great a mistake, and was glad to change"
766 "the subject. Fortunately it was not difficult to do, for Steerforth"
766 "could always pass from one subject to another with a carelessness and"
766 "lightness that were his own."
766 ""
766 "Lunch succeeded to our sight-seeing, and the short winter day wore away"
766 "so fast, that it was dusk when the stage-coach stopped with us at an"
766 "old brick house at Highgate on the summit of the hill. An elderly lady,"
766 "though not very far advanced in years, with a proud carriage and"
766 "a handsome face, was in the doorway as we alighted; and greeting"
766 "Steerforth as 'My dearest James,' folded him in her arms. To this lady"
766 "he presented me as his mother, and she gave me a stately welcome."
766 ""
766 "It was a genteel old-fashioned house, very quiet and orderly. From the"
766 "windows of my room I saw all London lying in the distance like a great"
766 "vapour, with here and there some lights twinkling through it. I had only"
766 "time, in dressing, to glance at the solid furniture, the framed pieces"
766 "of work (done, I supposed, by Steerforth's mother when she was a girl),"
766 "and some pictures in crayons of ladies with powdered hair and bodices,"
766 "coming and going on the walls, as the newly-kindled fire crackled and"
766 "sputtered, when I was called to dinner."
766 ""
766 "There was a second lady in the dining-room, of a slight short figure,"
766 "dark, and not agreeable to look at, but with some appearance of good"
766 "looks too, who attracted my attention: perhaps because I had not"
766 "expected to see her; perhaps because I found myself sitting opposite"
766 "to her; perhaps because of something really remarkable in her. She had"
766 "black hair and eager black eyes, and was thin, and had a scar upon her"
766 "lip. It was an old scar--I should rather call it seam, for it was not"
766 "discoloured, and had healed years ago--which had once cut through her"
766 "mouth, downward towards the chin, but was now barely visible across"
766 "the table, except above and on her upper lip, the shape of which it had"
766 "altered. I concluded in my own mind that she was about thirty years"
766 "of age, and that she wished to be married. She was a little"
766 "dilapidated--like a house--with having been so long to let; yet had, as"
766 "I have said, an appearance of good looks. Her thinness seemed to be the"
766 "effect of some wasting fire within her, which found a vent in her gaunt"
766 "eyes."
766 ""
766 "She was introduced as Miss Dartle, and both Steerforth and his mother"
766 "called her Rosa. I found that she lived there, and had been for a long"
766 "time Mrs. Steerforth's companion. It appeared to me that she never said"
766 "anything she wanted to say, outright; but hinted it, and made a great"
766 "deal more of it by this practice. For example, when Mrs. Steerforth"
766 "observed, more in jest than earnest, that she feared her son led but a"
766 "wild life at college, Miss Dartle put in thus:"
766 ""
766 "'Oh, really? You know how ignorant I am, and that I only ask for"
766 "information, but isn't it always so? I thought that kind of life was"
766 "on all hands understood to be--eh?' 'It is education for a very grave"
766 "profession, if you mean that, Rosa,' Mrs. Steerforth answered with some"
766 "coldness."
766 ""
766 "'Oh! Yes! That's very true,' returned Miss Dartle. 'But isn't it,"
766 "though?--I want to be put right, if I am wrong--isn't it, really?'"
766 ""
766 "'Really what?' said Mrs. Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'Oh! You mean it's not!' returned Miss Dartle. 'Well, I'm very glad to"
766 "hear it! Now, I know what to do! That's the advantage of asking. I shall"
766 "never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy,"
766 "and so forth, in connexion with that life, any more.'"
766 ""
766 "'And you will be right,' said Mrs. Steerforth. 'My son's tutor is a"
766 "conscientious gentleman; and if I had not implicit reliance on my son, I"
766 "should have reliance on him.'"
766 ""
766 "'Should you?' said Miss Dartle. 'Dear me! Conscientious, is he? Really"
766 "conscientious, now?'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes, I am convinced of it,' said Mrs. Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'How very nice!' exclaimed Miss Dartle. 'What a comfort! Really"
766 "conscientious? Then he's not--but of course he can't be, if he's really"
766 "conscientious. Well, I shall be quite happy in my opinion of him, from"
766 "this time. You can't think how it elevates him in my opinion, to know"
766 "for certain that he's really conscientious!'"
766 ""
766 "Her own views of every question, and her correction of everything that"
766 "was said to which she was opposed, Miss Dartle insinuated in the same"
766 "way: sometimes, I could not conceal from myself, with great power,"
766 "though in contradiction even of Steerforth. An instance happened before"
766 "dinner was done. Mrs. Steerforth speaking to me about my intention"
766 "of going down into Suffolk, I said at hazard how glad I should be, if"
766 "Steerforth would only go there with me; and explaining to him that I was"
766 "going to see my old nurse, and Mr. Peggotty's family, I reminded him of"
766 "the boatman whom he had seen at school."
766 ""
766 "'Oh! That bluff fellow!' said Steerforth. 'He had a son with him, hadn't"
766 "he?'"
766 ""
766 "'No. That was his nephew,' I replied; 'whom he adopted, though, as"
766 "a son. He has a very pretty little niece too, whom he adopted as a"
766 "daughter. In short, his house--or rather his boat, for he lives in one,"
766 "on dry land--is full of people who are objects of his generosity and"
766 "kindness. You would be delighted to see that household.'"
766 ""
766 "'Should I?' said Steerforth. 'Well, I think I should. I must see what"
766 "can be done. It would be worth a journey (not to mention the pleasure of"
766 "a journey with you, Daisy), to see that sort of people together, and to"
766 "make one of 'em.'"
766 ""
766 "My heart leaped with a new hope of pleasure. But it was in reference"
766 "to the tone in which he had spoken of 'that sort of people', that Miss"
766 "Dartle, whose sparkling eyes had been watchful of us, now broke in"
766 "again."
766 ""
766 "'Oh, but, really? Do tell me. Are they, though?' she said."
766 ""
766 "'Are they what? And are who what?' said Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'That sort of people.---Are they really animals and clods, and beings of"
766 "another order? I want to know SO much.'"
766 ""
766 "'Why, there's a pretty wide separation between them and us,' said"
766 "Steerforth, with indifference. 'They are not to be expected to be"
766 "as sensitive as we are. Their delicacy is not to be shocked, or hurt"
766 "easily. They are wonderfully virtuous, I dare say--some people contend"
766 "for that, at least; and I am sure I don't want to contradict them--but"
766 "they have not very fine natures, and they may be thankful that, like"
766 "their coarse rough skins, they are not easily wounded.'"
766 ""
766 "'Really!' said Miss Dartle. 'Well, I don't know, now, when I have been"
766 "better pleased than to hear that. It's so consoling! It's such a delight"
766 "to know that, when they suffer, they don't feel! Sometimes I have been"
766 "quite uneasy for that sort of people; but now I shall just dismiss the"
766 "idea of them, altogether. Live and learn. I had my doubts, I confess,"
766 "but now they're cleared up. I didn't know, and now I do know, and that"
766 "shows the advantage of asking--don't it?'"
766 ""
766 "I believed that Steerforth had said what he had, in jest, or to draw"
766 "Miss Dartle out; and I expected him to say as much when she was gone,"
766 "and we two were sitting before the fire. But he merely asked me what I"
766 "thought of her."
766 ""
766 "'She is very clever, is she not?' I asked."
766 ""
766 "'Clever! She brings everything to a grindstone,' said Steerforth, and"
766 "sharpens it, as she has sharpened her own face and figure these years"
766 "past. She has worn herself away by constant sharpening. She is all"
766 "edge.'"
766 ""
766 "'What a remarkable scar that is upon her lip!' I said."
766 ""
766 "Steerforth's face fell, and he paused a moment."
766 ""
766 "'Why, the fact is,' he returned, 'I did that.'"
766 ""
766 "'By an unfortunate accident!'"
766 ""
766 "'No. I was a young boy, and she exasperated me, and I threw a hammer at"
766 "her. A promising young angel I must have been!' I was deeply sorry to"
766 "have touched on such a painful theme, but that was useless now."
766 ""
766 "'She has borne the mark ever since, as you see,' said Steerforth; 'and"
766 "she'll bear it to her grave, if she ever rests in one--though I can"
766 "hardly believe she will ever rest anywhere. She was the motherless child"
766 "of a sort of cousin of my father's. He died one day. My mother, who was"
766 "then a widow, brought her here to be company to her. She has a couple of"
766 "thousand pounds of her own, and saves the interest of it every year, to"
766 "add to the principal. There's the history of Miss Rosa Dartle for you.'"
766 ""
766 "'And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Humph!' retorted Steerforth, looking at the fire. 'Some brothers are"
766 "not loved over much; and some love--but help yourself, Copperfield!"
766 "We'll drink the daisies of the field, in compliment to you; and the"
766 "lilies of the valley that toil not, neither do they spin, in compliment"
766 "to me--the more shame for me!' A moody smile that had overspread his"
766 "features cleared off as he said this merrily, and he was his own frank,"
766 "winning self again."
766 ""
766 "I could not help glancing at the scar with a painful interest when we"
766 "went in to tea. It was not long before I observed that it was the most"
766 "susceptible part of her face, and that, when she turned pale, that mark"
766 "altered first, and became a dull, lead-coloured streak, lengthening out"
766 "to its full extent, like a mark in invisible ink brought to the fire."
766 "There was a little altercation between her and Steerforth about a cast"
766 "of the dice at back gammon--when I thought her, for one moment, in a"
766 "storm of rage; and then I saw it start forth like the old writing on the"
766 "wall."
766 ""
766 "It was no matter of wonder to me to find Mrs. Steerforth devoted to her"
766 "son. She seemed to be able to speak or think about nothing else. She"
766 "showed me his picture as an infant, in a locket, with some of his"
766 "baby-hair in it; she showed me his picture as he had been when I first"
766 "knew him; and she wore at her breast his picture as he was now. All the"
766 "letters he had ever written to her, she kept in a cabinet near her own"
766 "chair by the fire; and she would have read me some of them, and I should"
766 "have been very glad to hear them too, if he had not interposed, and"
766 "coaxed her out of the design."
766 ""
766 "'It was at Mr. Creakle's, my son tells me, that you first became"
766 "acquainted,' said Mrs. Steerforth, as she and I were talking at one"
766 "table, while they played backgammon at another. 'Indeed, I recollect his"
766 "speaking, at that time, of a pupil younger than himself who had taken"
766 "his fancy there; but your name, as you may suppose, has not lived in my"
766 "memory.'"

766 "'He was very generous and noble to me in those days, I assure you,"

766 ""
766 "'He is always generous and noble,' said Mrs. Steerforth, proudly."

766 "I subscribed to this with all my heart, God knows. She knew I did; for"
766 "the stateliness of her manner already abated towards me, except when she"
766 "spoke in praise of him, and then her air was always lofty."
766 ""
766 "'It was not a fit school generally for my son,' said she; 'far from it;"
766 "but there were particular circumstances to be considered at the time, of"
766 "more importance even than that selection. My son's high spirit made"
766 "it desirable that he should be placed with some man who felt its"
766 "superiority, and would be content to bow himself before it; and we found"
766 "such a man there.'"
766 ""
766 "I knew that, knowing the fellow. And yet I did not despise him the more"
766 "for it, but thought it a redeeming quality in him if he could be allowed"
766 "any grace for not resisting one so irresistible as Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'My son's great capacity was tempted on, there, by a feeling of"
766 "voluntary emulation and conscious pride,' the fond lady went on to say."
766 "'He would have risen against all constraint; but he found himself the"
766 "monarch of the place, and he haughtily determined to be worthy of his"

766 "competitor,' she pursued. 'My son informs me, Mr. Copperfield, that"
766 "you were quite devoted to him, and that when you met yesterday you made"
766 "yourself known to him with tears of joy. I should be an affected woman"

766 "Miss Dartle played backgammon as eagerly as she did everything else."
766 "If I had seen her, first, at the board, I should have fancied that her"

766 "When the evening was pretty far spent, and a tray of glasses and"

766 "talking about Traddles and all the rest of them at old Salem House, went"
766 "upstairs together. Steerforth's room was next to mine, and I went in to"
766 "look at it. It was a picture of comfort, full of easy-chairs, cushions"
766 "and footstools, worked by his mother's hand, and with no sort of thing"
766 "omitted that could help to render it complete. Finally, her handsome"

766 "now showing the whole extent of the wound inflicted by the hammer, as I"
766 "had seen it when she was passionate."

766 "I wondered peevishly why they couldn't put her anywhere else instead"

766 "extinguished my light, and went to bed. But, as I fell asleep, I could"
766 "not forget that she was still there looking, 'Is it really, though?"

766 "There was a servant in that house, a man who, I understood, was usually"
766 "with Steerforth, and had come into his service at the University, who"
766 "was in appearance a pattern of respectability. I believe there never"
766 "existed in his station a more respectable-looking man. He was taciturn,"
766 "soft-footed, very quiet in his manner, deferential, observant, always at"
766 "hand when wanted, and never near when not wanted; but his great claim to"
766 "consideration was his respectability. He had not a pliant face, he had"
766 "rather a stiff neck, rather a tight smooth head with short hair clinging"
766 "to it at the sides, a soft way of speaking, with a peculiar habit of"
766 "whispering the letter S so distinctly, that he seemed to use it"
766 "oftener than any other man; but every peculiarity that he had he made"
766 "respectable. If his nose had been upside-down, he would have made that"
766 "respectable. He surrounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability,"
766 "and walked secure in it. It would have been next to impossible to"
766 "suspect him of anything wrong, he was so thoroughly respectable."
766 "Nobody could have thought of putting him in a livery, he was so highly"
766 "respectable. To have imposed any derogatory work upon him, would have"
766 "been to inflict a wanton insult on the feelings of a most respectable"
766 "man. And of this, I noticed--the women-servants in the household were"
766 "so intuitively conscious, that they always did such work themselves, and"
766 "generally while he read the paper by the pantry fire."
766 ""
766 "Such a self-contained man I never saw. But in that quality, as in every"
766 "other he possessed, he only seemed to be the more respectable. Even the"
766 "fact that no one knew his Christian name, seemed to form a part of his"
766 "respectability. Nothing could be objected against his surname, Littimer,"
766 "by which he was known. Peter might have been hanged, or Tom transported;"
766 "but Littimer was perfectly respectable."
766 ""
766 "It was occasioned, I suppose, by the reverend nature of respectability"
766 "in the abstract, but I felt particularly young in this man's presence."
766 "How old he was himself, I could not guess--and that again went to his"
766 "credit on the same score; for in the calmness of respectability he might"
766 "have numbered fifty years as well as thirty."
766 ""
766 "Littimer was in my room in the morning before I was up, to bring me that"
766 "reproachful shaving-water, and to put out my clothes. When I undrew the"
766 "curtains and looked out of bed, I saw him, in an equable temperature"
766 "of respectability, unaffected by the east wind of January, and not"
766 "even breathing frostily, standing my boots right and left in the first"
766 "dancing position, and blowing specks of dust off my coat as he laid it"
766 "down like a baby."
766 ""
766 "I gave him good morning, and asked him what o'clock it was. He took"
766 "out of his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw, and"
766 "preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far, looked in at the"
766 "face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster, shut it up again, and"
766 "said, if I pleased, it was half past eight."
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested, sir.'"
766 ""
766 "'Thank you,' said I, 'very well indeed. Is Mr. Steerforth quite well?'"

766 "'Thank you, sir, Mr. Steerforth is tolerably well.' Another of his"

766 "'Nothing, I thank you.'"
766 ""
766 "'I thank YOU, sir, if you please'; and with that, and with a little"
766 "inclination of his head when he passed the bed-side, as an apology for"
766 "correcting me, he went out, shutting the door as delicately as if I had"
766 "just fallen into a sweet sleep on which my life depended."
766 ""
766 "Every morning we held exactly this conversation: never any more, and"
766 "never any less: and yet, invariably, however far I might have been"
766 "lifted out of myself over-night, and advanced towards maturer years,"
766 "by Steerforth's companionship, or Mrs. Steerforth's confidence, or Miss"
766 "Dartle's conversation, in the presence of this most respectable man I"
766 "became, as our smaller poets sing, 'a boy again'."
766 ""
766 "He got horses for us; and Steerforth, who knew everything, gave me"
766 "lessons in riding. He provided foils for us, and Steerforth gave me"
766 "lessons in fencing--gloves, and I began, of the same master, to improve"
766 "in boxing. It gave me no manner of concern that Steerforth should find"
766 "me a novice in these sciences, but I never could bear to show my want of"
766 "skill before the respectable Littimer. I had no reason to believe"
766 "that Littimer understood such arts himself; he never led me to suppose"
766 "anything of the kind, by so much as the vibration of one of his"
766 "respectable eyelashes; yet whenever he was by, while we were practising,"
766 "I felt myself the greenest and most inexperienced of mortals."
766 ""
766 "I am particular about this man, because he made a particular effect on"
766 "me at that time, and because of what took place thereafter."
766 ""
766 "The week passed away in a most delightful manner. It passed rapidly, as"
766 "may be supposed, to one entranced as I was; and yet it gave me so many"
766 "occasions for knowing Steerforth better, and admiring him more in a"
766 "thousand respects, that at its close I seemed to have been with him"
766 "for a much longer time. A dashing way he had of treating me like a"
766 "plaything, was more agreeable to me than any behaviour he could have"
766 "adopted. It reminded me of our old acquaintance; it seemed the natural"
766 "sequel of it; it showed me that he was unchanged; it relieved me of"
766 "any uneasiness I might have felt, in comparing my merits with his, and"
766 "measuring my claims upon his friendship by any equal standard; above"
766 "all, it was a familiar, unrestrained, affectionate demeanour that he"
766 "used towards no one else. As he had treated me at school differently"
766 "from all the rest, I joyfully believed that he treated me in life unlike"
766 "any other friend he had. I believed that I was nearer to his heart than"
766 "any other friend, and my own heart warmed with attachment to him. He"
766 "made up his mind to go with me into the country, and the day arrived for"
766 "our departure. He had been doubtful at first whether to take Littimer"
766 "or not, but decided to leave him at home. The respectable creature,"
766 "satisfied with his lot whatever it was, arranged our portmanteaux on"
766 "the little carriage that was to take us into London, as if they were"
766 "intended to defy the shocks of ages, and received my modestly proffered"
766 "donation with perfect tranquillity."
766 ""
766 "We bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle, with many thanks on"
766 "my part, and much kindness on the devoted mother's. The last thing I"
766 "saw was Littimer's unruffled eye; fraught, as I fancied, with the silent"
766 "conviction that I was very young indeed."
766 ""
766 "What I felt, in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar places,"
766 "I shall not endeavour to describe. We went down by the Mail. I was"
766 "so concerned, I recollect, even for the honour of Yarmouth, that when"
766 "Steerforth said, as we drove through its dark streets to the inn, that,"
766 "as well as he could make out, it was a good, queer, out-of-the-way kind"
766 "of hole, I was highly pleased. We went to bed on our arrival (I observed"
766 "a pair of dirty shoes and gaiters in connexion with my old friend the"
766 "Dolphin as we passed that door), and breakfasted late in the morning."
766 "Steerforth, who was in great spirits, had been strolling about the"
766 "beach before I was up, and had made acquaintance, he said, with half the"
766 "boatmen in the place. Moreover, he had seen, in the distance, what he"
766 "was sure must be the identical house of Mr. Peggotty, with smoke coming"
766 "out of the chimney; and had had a great mind, he told me, to walk in and"
766 "swear he was myself grown out of knowledge."

766 ""
766 "I answered, laughing, that I thought we might get through it in that"
766 "time, but that he must come also; for he would find that his renown had"
766 "preceded him, and that he was almost as great a personage as I was."
766 ""
766 "'I'll come anywhere you like,' said Steerforth, 'or do anything you"

766 ""
766 "I gave him minute directions for finding the residence of Mr. Barkis,"
766 "carrier to Blunderstone and elsewhere; and, on this understanding, went"
766 "out alone. There was a sharp bracing air; the ground was dry; the sea"
766 "was crisp and clear; the sun was diffusing abundance of light, if not"
766 "much warmth; and everything was fresh and lively. I was so fresh and"
766 "lively myself, in the pleasure of being there, that I could have stopped"
766 "the people in the streets and shaken hands with them."
766 ""
766 "The streets looked small, of course. The streets that we have only seen"
766 "as children always do, I believe, when we go back to them. But I had"
766 "forgotten nothing in them, and found nothing changed, until I came to"

766 "a little child in her arms, while another little fellow clung to her"
766 "apron. I had no difficulty in recognizing either Minnie or Minnie's"
766 "children. The glass door of the parlour was not open; but in the"

766 "consequence, an ill-natured story got about, that Em'ly wanted to be a"

766 "doubt that she was near. On my asking now, if that were not so, Mr."
766 "Omer nodded yes, and nodded towards the door of the parlour. My hurried"
766 "inquiry if I might peep in, was answered with a free permission; and,"
766 "looking through the glass, I saw her sitting at her work. I saw her, a"
766 "most beautiful little creature, with the cloudless blue eyes, that had"
766 "looked into my childish heart, turned laughingly upon another child"
766 "of Minnie's who was playing near her; with enough of wilfulness in her"

766 "not half express how readily and gaily. He went into Mr. Barkis's room"
766 "like light and air, brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy"
766 "weather. There was no noise, no effort, no consciousness, in anything"
766 "he did; but in everything an indescribable lightness, a seeming"
766 "impossibility of doing anything else, or doing anything better, which"

766 "I thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as Ham was now,"
766 "trembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little creature"
766 "who had won his heart. I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by"
766 "Mr. Peggotty and by himself, was, in itself, affecting. I was affected"
766 "by the story altogether. How far my emotions were influenced by the"
766 "recollections of my childhood, I don't know. Whether I had come there"
766 "with any lingering fancy that I was still to love little Em'ly, I don't"
766 "know. I know that I was filled with pleasure by all this; but, at first,"
766 "with an indescribably sensitive pleasure, that a very little would have"
766 "changed to pain."
766 ""
766 "Therefore, if it had depended upon me to touch the prevailing chord"
766 "among them with any skill, I should have made a poor hand of it. But it"
766 "depended upon Steerforth; and he did it with such address, that in a few"
766 "minutes we were all as easy and as happy as it was possible to be."
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Peggotty,' he said, 'you are a thoroughly good fellow, and deserve"
766 "to be as happy as you are tonight. My hand upon it! Ham, I give you"
766 "joy, my boy. My hand upon that, too! Daisy, stir the fire, and make it a"
766 "brisk one! and Mr. Peggotty, unless you can induce your gentle niece to"
766 "come back (for whom I vacate this seat in the corner), I shall go."
766 "Any gap at your fireside on such a night--such a gap least of all--I"
766 "wouldn't make, for the wealth of the Indies!'"
766 ""
766 "So Mr. Peggotty went into my old room to fetch little Em'ly. At first"
766 "little Em'ly didn't like to come, and then Ham went. Presently they"
766 "brought her to the fireside, very much confused, and very shy,--but"
766 "she soon became more assured when she found how gently and respectfully"
766 "Steerforth spoke to her; how skilfully he avoided anything that would"
766 "embarrass her; how he talked to Mr. Peggotty of boats, and ships, and"
766 "tides, and fish; how he referred to me about the time when he had seen"
766 "Mr. Peggotty at Salem House; how delighted he was with the boat and all"
766 "belonging to it; how lightly and easily he carried on, until he brought"
766 "us, by degrees, into a charmed circle, and we were all talking away"
766 "without any reserve."
766 ""
766 "Em'ly, indeed, said little all the evening; but she looked, and"
766 "listened, and her face got animated, and she was charming. Steerforth"
766 "told a story of a dismal shipwreck (which arose out of his talk with Mr."
766 "Peggotty), as if he saw it all before him--and little Em'ly's eyes were"
766 "fastened on him all the time, as if she saw it too. He told us a merry"
766 "adventure of his own, as a relief to that, with as much gaiety as if the"
766 "narrative were as fresh to him as it was to us--and little Em'ly"
766 "laughed until the boat rang with the musical sounds, and we all laughed"
766 "(Steerforth too), in irresistible sympathy with what was so pleasant and"
766 "light-hearted. He got Mr. Peggotty to sing, or rather to roar, 'When"
766 "the stormy winds do blow, do blow, do blow'; and he sang a sailor's"
766 "song himself, so pathetically and beautifully, that I could have almost"
766 "fancied that the real wind creeping sorrowfully round the house, and"
766 "murmuring low through our unbroken silence, was there to listen."
766 ""
766 "As to Mrs. Gummidge, he roused that victim of despondency with a success"
766 "never attained by anyone else (so Mr. Peggotty informed me), since"
766 "the decease of the old one. He left her so little leisure for being"
766 "miserable, that she said next day she thought she must have been"
766 "bewitched."
766 ""
766 "But he set up no monopoly of the general attention, or the conversation."
766 "When little Em'ly grew more courageous, and talked (but still bashfully)"
766 "across the fire to me, of our old wanderings upon the beach, to pick up"
766 "shells and pebbles; and when I asked her if she recollected how I used"
766 "to be devoted to her; and when we both laughed and reddened, casting"
766 "these looks back on the pleasant old times, so unreal to look at now; he"
766 "was silent and attentive, and observed us thoughtfully. She sat, at this"
766 "time, and all the evening, on the old locker in her old little corner"
766 "by the fire--Ham beside her, where I used to sit. I could not satisfy"
766 "myself whether it was in her own little tormenting way, or in a maidenly"
766 "reserve before us, that she kept quite close to the wall, and away from"
766 "him; but I observed that she did so, all the evening."
766 ""
766 "As I remember, it was almost midnight when we took our leave. We had had"
766 "some biscuit and dried fish for supper, and Steerforth had produced from"
766 "his pocket a full flask of Hollands, which we men (I may say we men,"
766 "now, without a blush) had emptied. We parted merrily; and as they all"
766 "stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our"
766 "road, I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em'ly peeping after us, from"
766 "behind Ham, and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we"
766 "went."
766 ""
766 "'A most engaging little Beauty!' said Steerforth, taking my arm. 'Well!"

766 "He had been so hearty with him, and with them all, that I felt a shock"
766 "in this unexpected and cold reply. But turning quickly upon him, and"
766 "seeing a laugh in his eyes, I answered, much relieved:"
766 ""
766 "'Ah, Steerforth! It's well for you to joke about the poor! You may"
766 "skirmish with Miss Dartle, or try to hide your sympathies in jest from"
766 "me, but I know better. When I see how perfectly you understand them, how"
766 "exquisitely you can enter into happiness like this plain fisherman's,"
766 "or humour a love like my old nurse's, I know that there is not a joy or"
766 "sorrow, not an emotion, of such people, that can be indifferent to you."

766 "He stopped, and, looking in my face, said, 'Daisy, I believe you are"

766 ""
766 "Steerforth and I stayed for more than a fortnight in that part of the"
766 "country. We were very much together, I need not say; but occasionally we"
766 "were asunder for some hours at a time. He was a good sailor, and I was"
766 "but an indifferent one; and when he went out boating with Mr. Peggotty,"
766 "which was a favourite amusement of his, I generally remained ashore. My"
766 "occupation of Peggotty's spare-room put a constraint upon me, from which"
766 "he was free: for, knowing how assiduously she attended on Mr. Barkis"
766 "all day, I did not like to remain out late at night; whereas Steerforth,"
766 "lying at the Inn, had nothing to consult but his own humour. Thus it"
766 "came about, that I heard of his making little treats for the fishermen"
766 "at Mr. Peggotty's house of call, 'The Willing Mind', after I was in bed,"
766 "and of his being afloat, wrapped in fishermen's clothes, whole moonlight"
766 "nights, and coming back when the morning tide was at flood. By this"
766 "time, however, I knew that his restless nature and bold spirits"
766 "delighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather, as in any other"
766 "means of excitement that presented itself freshly to him; so none of his"
766 "proceedings surprised me."
766 ""
766 "Another cause of our being sometimes apart, was, that I had naturally an"
766 "interest in going over to Blunderstone, and revisiting the old familiar"
766 "scenes of my childhood; while Steerforth, after being there once, had"
766 "naturally no great interest in going there again. Hence, on three or"
766 "four days that I can at once recall, we went our several ways after an"
766 "early breakfast, and met again at a late dinner. I had no idea how he"
766 "employed his time in the interval, beyond a general knowledge that"
766 "he was very popular in the place, and had twenty means of actively"
766 "diverting himself where another man might not have found one."
766 ""
766 "For my own part, my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recall"
766 "every yard of the old road as I went along it, and to haunt the old"
766 "spots, of which I never tired. I haunted them, as my memory had often"
766 "done, and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I"
766 "was far away. The grave beneath the tree, where both my parents lay--on"
766 "which I had looked out, when it was my father's only, with such curious"
766 "feelings of compassion, and by which I had stood, so desolate, when it"
766 "was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby--the grave which"
766 "Peggotty's own faithful care had ever since kept neat, and made a garden"
766 "of, I walked near, by the hour. It lay a little off the churchyard path,"
766 "in a quiet corner, not so far removed but I could read the names"
766 "upon the stone as I walked to and fro, startled by the sound of the"
766 "church-bell when it struck the hour, for it was like a departed voice to"
766 "me. My reflections at these times were always associated with the figure"
766 "I was to make in life, and the distinguished things I was to do. My"
766 "echoing footsteps went to no other tune, but were as constant to that as"
766 "if I had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother's"
766 "side."
766 ""
766 "There were great changes in my old home. The ragged nests, so long"
766 "deserted by the rooks, were gone; and the trees were lopped and topped"
766 "out of their remembered shapes. The garden had run wild, and half the"
766 "windows of the house were shut up. It was occupied, but only by a poor"
766 "lunatic gentleman, and the people who took care of him. He was always"
766 "sitting at my little window, looking out into the churchyard; and I"
766 "wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies"
766 "that used to occupy mine, on the rosy mornings when I peeped out of"
766 "that same little window in my night-clothes, and saw the sheep quietly"
766 "feeding in the light of the rising sun."
766 ""
766 "Our old neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Grayper, were gone to South America,"
766 "and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house,"
766 "and stained the outer walls. Mr. Chillip was married again to a tall,"
766 "raw-boned, high-nosed wife; and they had a weazen little baby, with a"
766 "heavy head that it couldn't hold up, and two weak staring eyes, with"
766 "which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born."

766 "It was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that I used to"
766 "linger about my native place, until the reddening winter sun admonished"
766 "me that it was time to start on my returning walk. But, when the place"
766 "was left behind, and especially when Steerforth and I were happily"
766 "seated over our dinner by a blazing fire, it was delicious to think of"
766 "having been there. So it was, though in a softened degree, when I"
766 "went to my neat room at night; and, turning over the leaves of the"
766 "crocodile-book (which was always there, upon a little table), remembered"
766 "with a grateful heart how blest I was in having such a friend as"
766 "Steerforth, such a friend as Peggotty, and such a substitute for what I"
766 "had lost as my excellent and generous aunt."

766 "MY nearest way to Yarmouth, in coming back from these long walks, was by"
766 "a ferry. It landed me on the flat between the town and the sea, which I"
766 "could make straight across, and so save myself a considerable circuit by"
766 "the high road. Mr. Peggotty's house being on that waste-place, and not"
766 "a hundred yards out of my track, I always looked in as I went by."

766 "before the fire. He was so intent upon his own reflections that he was"
766 "quite unconscious of my approach. This, indeed, he might easily have"
766 "been if he had been less absorbed, for footsteps fell noiselessly on the"
766 "sandy ground outside; but even my entrance failed to rouse him. I was"

766 "She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to"
766 "them, and blushed as she gave it to Steerforth and to me. When they"
766 "passed on, after we had exchanged a few words, she did not like to"
766 "replace that hand, but, still appearing timid and constrained, walked"
766 "by herself. I thought all this very pretty and engaging, and Steerforth"
766 "seemed to think so too, as we looked after them fading away in the light"
766 "of a young moon."
766 ""
766 "Suddenly there passed us--evidently following them--a young woman whose"
766 "approach we had not observed, but whose face I saw as she went by, and"
766 "thought I had a faint remembrance of. She was lightly dressed; looked"
766 "bold, and haggard, and flaunting, and poor; but seemed, for the time, to"
766 "have given all that to the wind which was blowing, and to have nothing"
766 "in her mind but going after them. As the dark distant level, absorbing"
766 "their figures into itself, left but itself visible between us and the"
766 "sea and clouds, her figure disappeared in like manner, still no nearer"
766 "to them than before."
766 ""
766 "'That is a black shadow to be following the girl,' said Steerforth,"
766 "standing still; 'what does it mean?'"

766 "thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight.'"
766 ""
766 "'Why?' I asked."
766 ""
766 "'For no better reason, truly, than because I was thinking,' he said,"
766 "after a pause, 'of something like it, when it came by. Where the Devil"
766 "did it come from, I wonder!'"
766 ""
766 "'From the shadow of this wall, I think,' said I, as we emerged upon a"
766 "road on which a wall abutted."

766 "with it. Now for our dinner!'"
766 ""
766 "But he looked again over his shoulder towards the sea-line glimmering"
766 "afar off, and yet again. And he wondered about it, in some broken"
766 "expressions, several times, in the short remainder of our walk; and only"
766 "seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us,"
766 "seated warm and merry, at table."
766 ""
766 "Littimer was there, and had his usual effect upon me. When I said to"
766 "him that I hoped Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle were well, he answered"
766 "respectfully (and of course respectably), that they were tolerably well,"
766 "he thanked me, and had sent their compliments. This was all, and yet he"
766 "seemed to me to say as plainly as a man could say: 'You are very young,"
766 "sir; you are exceedingly young.'"

766 "We had almost finished dinner, when taking a step or two towards the"
766 "table, from the corner where he kept watch upon us, or rather upon me,"

766 ""
766 "'I beg your pardon, sir. Miss Mowcher is down here.'"

766 ""
766 "'It appears to be her native part of the country, sir. She informs me"
766 "that she makes one of her professional visits here, every year, sir."

766 "might have the honour of waiting on you after dinner, sir.'"
766 ""
766 "'Do you know the Giantess in question, Daisy?' inquired Steerforth."

766 "disadvantage before Littimer--that Miss Mowcher and I were wholly"
766 "unacquainted."
766 ""
766 "'Then you shall know her,' said Steerforth, 'for she is one of the seven"
766 "wonders of the world. When Miss Mowcher comes, show her in.'"
766 ""
766 "I felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady, especially as"
766 "Steerforth burst into a fit of laughing when I referred to her, and"
766 "positively refused to answer any question of which I made her the"
766 "subject. I remained, therefore, in a state of considerable expectation"
766 "until the cloth had been removed some half an hour, and we were sitting"
766 "over our decanter of wine before the fire, when the door opened, and"
766 "Littimer, with his habitual serenity quite undisturbed, announced:"
766 ""
766 "'Miss Mowcher!'"

766 "the doorway, thinking that Miss Mowcher was a long while making her"
766 "appearance, when, to my infinite astonishment, there came waddling round"
766 "a sofa which stood between me and it, a pursy dwarf, of about forty"
766 "or forty-five, with a very large head and face, a pair of roguish grey"
766 "eyes, and such extremely little arms, that, to enable herself to lay a"
766 "finger archly against her snub nose, as she ogled Steerforth, she was"
766 "obliged to meet the finger half-way, and lay her nose against it."
766 "Her chin, which was what is called a double chin, was so fat that it"
766 "entirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet, bow and all. Throat she"
766 "had none; waist she had none; legs she had none, worth mentioning; for"
766 "though she was more than full-sized down to where her waist would have"
766 "been, if she had had any, and though she terminated, as human beings"
766 "generally do, in a pair of feet, she was so short that she stood at a"
766 "common-sized chair as at a table, resting a bag she carried on the seat."
766 "This lady--dressed in an off-hand, easy style; bringing her nose and her"
766 "forefinger together, with the difficulty I have described; standing with"
766 "her head necessarily on one side, and, with one of her sharp eyes shut"
766 "up, making an uncommonly knowing face--after ogling Steerforth for a few"
766 "moments, broke into a torrent of words."
766 ""
766 "'What! My flower!' she pleasantly began, shaking her large head at him."

766 "do so far away from home? Up to mischief, I'll be bound. Oh, you're a"
766 "downy fellow, Steerforth, so you are, and I'm another, ain't I? Ha, ha,"
766 "ha! You'd have betted a hundred pound to five, now, that you wouldn't"
766 "have seen me here, wouldn't you? Bless you, man alive, I'm everywhere."
766 "I'm here and there, and where not, like the conjurer's half-crown in the"

766 "a comfort you are to your blessed mother, ain't you, my dear boy, over"
766 "one of my shoulders, and I don't say which!'"

766 "Miss Mowcher untied her bonnet, at this passage of her discourse, threw"
766 "back the strings, and sat down, panting, on a footstool in front of"

766 "mahogany shelter above her head."

766 "'Oh my stars and what's-their-names!' she went on, clapping a hand on"
766 "each of her little knees, and glancing shrewdly at me, 'I'm of too full"
766 "a habit, that's the fact, Steerforth. After a flight of stairs, it gives"
766 "me as much trouble to draw every breath I want, as if it was a bucket of"

766 "last week--THERE'S a woman! How SHE wears!--and Mithers himself came"
766 "into the room where I was waiting for her--THERE'S a man! How HE wears!"
766 "and his wig too, for he's had it these ten years--and he went on at"
766 "that rate in the complimentary line, that I began to think I should be"
766 "obliged to ring the bell. Ha! ha! ha! He's a pleasant wretch, but he"
766 "wants principle.'"
766 ""
766 "'What were you doing for Lady Mithers?' asked Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'That's tellings, my blessed infant,' she retorted, tapping her nose"
766 "again, screwing up her face, and twinkling her eyes like an imp of"
766 "supernatural intelligence. 'Never YOU mind! You'd like to know whether"
766 "I stop her hair from falling off, or dye it, or touch up her"
766 "complexion, or improve her eyebrows, wouldn't you? And so you shall, my"
766 "darling--when I tell you! Do you know what my great grandfather's name"
766 "was?'"
766 ""
766 "'No,' said Steerforth."

766 "'It was Walker, my sweet pet,' replied Miss Mowcher, 'and he came of a"
766 "long line of Walkers, that I inherit all the Hookey estates from.'"
766 ""
766 "I never beheld anything approaching to Miss Mowcher's wink except Miss"
766 "Mowcher's self-possession. She had a wonderful way too, when listening"
766 "to what was said to her, or when waiting for an answer to what she had"
766 "said herself, of pausing with her head cunningly on one side, and one"
766 "eye turned up like a magpie's. Altogether I was lost in amazement,"
766 "and sat staring at her, quite oblivious, I am afraid, of the laws of"
766 "politeness."
766 ""
766 "She had by this time drawn the chair to her side, and was busily engaged"
766 "in producing from the bag (plunging in her short arm to the shoulder, at"
766 "every dive) a number of small bottles, sponges, combs, brushes, bits of"
766 "flannel, little pairs of curling-irons, and other instruments, which"
766 "she tumbled in a heap upon the chair. From this employment she suddenly"
766 "desisted, and said to Steerforth, much to my confusion:"

766 "sat. 'Quite tempting! I'm very fond of peaches. Happy to make your"
766 "acquaintance, Mr. Copperfield, I'm sure.'"

766 "'Oh, my goodness, how polite we are!' exclaimed Miss Mowcher, making a"
766 "preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand."
766 "'What a world of gammon and spinnage it is, though, ain't it!'"
766 ""
766 "This was addressed confidentially to both of us, as the morsel of a"

766 "again."
766 ""
766 "'What do you mean, Miss Mowcher?' said Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'Ha! ha! ha! What a refreshing set of humbugs we are, to be sure, ain't"
766 "we, my sweet child?' replied that morsel of a woman, feeling in the bag"
766 "with her head on one side and her eye in the air. 'Look here!' taking"
766 "something out. 'Scraps of the Russian Prince's nails. Prince Alphabet"
766 "turned topsy-turvy, I call him, for his name's got all the letters in"
766 "it, higgledy-piggledy.'"
766 ""
766 "'The Russian Prince is a client of yours, is he?' said Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'I believe you, my pet,' replied Miss Mowcher. 'I keep his nails in"
766 "order for him. Twice a week! Fingers and toes.'"
766 ""
766 "'He pays well, I hope?' said Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'Pays, as he speaks, my dear child--through the nose,' replied Miss"
766 "Mowcher. 'None of your close shavers the Prince ain't. You'd say so, if"
766 "you saw his moustachios. Red by nature, black by art.'"
766 ""
766 "'By your art, of course,' said Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "Miss Mowcher winked assent. 'Forced to send for me. Couldn't help it."
766 "The climate affected his dye; it did very well in Russia, but it was no"
766 "go here. You never saw such a rusty Prince in all your born days as he"
766 "was. Like old iron!' 'Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?'"
766 "inquired Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'Oh, you're a broth of a boy, ain't you?' returned Miss Mowcher, shaking"
766 "her head violently. 'I said, what a set of humbugs we were in general,"
766 "and I showed you the scraps of the Prince's nails to prove it. The"
766 "Prince's nails do more for me in private families of the genteel sort,"
766 "than all my talents put together. I always carry 'em about. They're the"
766 "best introduction. If Miss Mowcher cuts the Prince's nails, she must be"
766 "all right. I give 'em away to the young ladies. They put 'em in albums,"
766 "I believe. Ha! ha! ha! Upon my life, \"the whole social system\" (as"
766 "the men call it when they make speeches in Parliament) is a system of"
766 "Prince's nails!' said this least of women, trying to fold her short"
766 "arms, and nodding her large head."
766 ""
766 "Steerforth laughed heartily, and I laughed too. Miss Mowcher continuing"
766 "all the time to shake her head (which was very much on one side), and to"
766 "look into the air with one eye, and to wink with the other."
766 ""
766 "'Well, well!' she said, smiting her small knees, and rising, 'this is"
766 "not business. Come, Steerforth, let's explore the polar regions, and"
766 "have it over.'"
766 ""
766 "She then selected two or three of the little instruments, and a"
766 "little bottle, and asked (to my surprise) if the table would bear. On"
766 "Steerforth's replying in the affirmative, she pushed a chair against it,"
766 "and begging the assistance of my hand, mounted up, pretty nimbly, to the"
766 "top, as if it were a stage."
766 ""
766 "'If either of you saw my ankles,' she said, when she was safely"
766 "elevated, 'say so, and I'll go home and destroy myself!'"

766 ""
766 "'I did not,' said I."

766 "'Well then,' cried Miss Mowcher, 'I'll consent to live. Now, ducky,"
766 "ducky, ducky, come to Mrs. Bond and be killed.'"
766 ""
766 "This was an invocation to Steerforth to place himself under her hands;"
766 "who, accordingly, sat himself down, with his back to the table, and"
766 "his laughing face towards me, and submitted his head to her inspection,"
766 "evidently for no other purpose than our entertainment. To see Miss"
766 "Mowcher standing over him, looking at his rich profusion of brown"
766 "hair through a large round magnifying glass, which she took out of her"
766 "pocket, was a most amazing spectacle."
766 ""
766 "'You're a pretty fellow!' said Miss Mowcher, after a brief inspection."
766 "'You'd be as bald as a friar on the top of your head in twelve months,"
766 "but for me. Just half a minute, my young friend, and we'll give you a"
766 "polishing that shall keep your curls on for the next ten years!'"

766 "With this, she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to"
766 "one of the little bits of flannel, and, again imparting some of the"
766 "virtues of that preparation to one of the little brushes, began rubbing"
766 "and scraping away with both on the crown of Steerforth's head in the"
766 "busiest manner I ever witnessed, talking all the time."

766 ""
766 "'To drink?' returned Miss Mowcher, stopping to slap his cheek. 'To"
766 "doctor his own moustachios with, you know. There was a woman in the"
766 "shop--elderly female--quite a Griffin--who had never even heard of it"
766 "by name. \"Begging pardon, sir,\" said the Griffin to Charley, \"it's"

766 "little in that way myself. One Dowager, SHE calls it lip-salve. Another,"
766 "SHE calls it gloves. Another, SHE calls it tucker-edging. Another, SHE"
766 "calls it a fan. I call it whatever THEY call it. I supply it for 'em,"
766 "but we keep up the trick so, to one another, and make believe with"
766 "such a face, that they'd as soon think of laying it on, before a whole"
766 "drawing-room, as before me. And when I wait upon 'em, they'll say to"
766 "me sometimes--WITH IT ON--thick, and no mistake--\"How am I looking,"

766 "for any decoration within the range of her art, and that I was, for the"
766 "time being, proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which"
766 "she held up before one eye to enforce her persuasions, said we would"
766 "make a beginning on an early day, and requested the aid of my hand to"
766 "descend from her elevated station. Thus assisted, she skipped down with"
766 "much agility, and began to tie her double chin into her bonnet."

766 "ha! A wicked rascal, Ned, but droll! Now, I know I'm going to break"
766 "your hearts, but I am forced to leave you. You must call up all your"
766 "fortitude, and try to bear it. Good-bye, Mr. Copperfield! Take care of"
766 "yourself, jockey of Norfolk! How I have been rattling on! It's all"
766 "the fault of you two wretches. I forgive you! \"Bob swore!\"--as the"
766 "Englishman said for \"Good night\", when he first learnt French, and"
766 "thought it so like English. \"Bob swore,\" my ducks!'"

766 "With the bag slung over her arm, and rattling as she waddled away, she"

766 "laughing too; though I am not sure I should have done so, but for this"
766 "inducement. When we had had our laugh quite out, which was after some"
766 "time, he told me that Miss Mowcher had quite an extensive connexion, and"
766 "made herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways. Some"
766 "people trifled with her as a mere oddity, he said; but she was as"
766 "shrewdly and sharply observant as anyone he knew, and as long-headed as"
766 "she was short-armed. He told me that what she had said of being here,"
766 "and there, and everywhere, was true enough; for she made little darts"
766 "into the provinces, and seemed to pick up customers everywhere, and to"
766 "know everybody. I asked him what her disposition was: whether it was at"
766 "all mischievous, and if her sympathies were generally on the right side"
766 "of things: but, not succeeding in attracting his attention to these"
766 "questions after two or three attempts, I forbore or forgot to repeat"
766 "them. He told me instead, with much rapidity, a good deal about her"
766 "skill, and her profits; and about her being a scientific cupper, if I"
766 "should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity."

766 "else, change and change about; but it's always a very pleasant,"
766 "profitable little affair of private theatricals, presented to an"
766 "uncommonly select audience.'"
766 ""
766 "'But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?' said I, a little"
766 "puzzled. 'Are they?'"
766 ""
766 "'No,' returned Steerforth, 'the advocates are civilians--men who have"
766 "taken a doctor's degree at college--which is the first reason of my"
766 "knowing anything about it. The proctors employ the advocates. Both get"
766 "very comfortable fees, and altogether they make a mighty snug little"
766 "party. On the whole, I would recommend you to take to Doctors' Commons"
766 "kindly, David. They plume them-selves on their gentility there, I can"
766 "tell you, if that's any satisfaction.'"
766 ""
766 "I made allowance for Steerforth's light way of treating the subject,"
766 "and, considering it with reference to the staid air of gravity and"
766 "antiquity which I associated with that 'lazy old nook near St. Paul's"
766 "Churchyard', did not feel indisposed towards my aunt's suggestion; which"
766 "she left to my free decision, making no scruple of telling me that it"
766 "had occurred to her, on her lately visiting her own proctor in Doctors'"
766 "Commons for the purpose of settling her will in my favour."
766 ""
766 "'That's a laudable proceeding on the part of our aunt, at all events,'"
766 "said Steerforth, when I mentioned it; 'and one deserving of all"
766 "encouragement. Daisy, my advice is that you take kindly to Doctors'"
766 "Commons.'"
766 ""
766 "I quite made up my mind to do so. I then told Steerforth that my aunt"
766 "was in town awaiting me (as I found from her letter), and that she had"
766 "taken lodgings for a week at a kind of private hotel at Lincoln's Inn"
766 "Fields, where there was a stone staircase, and a convenient door in"
766 "the roof; my aunt being firmly persuaded that every house in London was"
766 "going to be burnt down every night."
766 ""
766 "We achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring to"
766 "Doctors' Commons, and anticipating the distant days when I should be a"
766 "proctor there, which Steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and"
766 "whimsical lights, that made us both merry. When we came to our journey's"
766 "end, he went home, engaging to call upon me next day but one; and I"
766 "drove to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where I found my aunt up, and waiting"
766 "supper."
766 ""
766 "If I had been round the world since we parted, we could hardly have been"
766 "better pleased to meet again. My aunt cried outright as she embraced me;"
766 "and said, pretending to laugh, that if my poor mother had been alive,"
766 "that silly little creature would have shed tears, she had no doubt."
766 ""
766 "'So you have left Mr. Dick behind, aunt?' said I. 'I am sorry for that."
766 "Ah, Janet, how do you do?'"
766 ""
766 "As Janet curtsied, hoping I was well, I observed my aunt's visage"
766 "lengthen very much."
766 ""
766 "'I am sorry for it, too,' said my aunt, rubbing her nose. 'I have had"
766 "no peace of mind, Trot, since I have been here.' Before I could ask why,"
766 "she told me."
766 ""
766 "'I am convinced,' said my aunt, laying her hand with melancholy firmness"
766 "on the table, 'that Dick's character is not a character to keep the"
766 "donkeys off. I am confident he wants strength of purpose. I ought to"
766 "have left Janet at home, instead, and then my mind might perhaps have"
766 "been at ease. If ever there was a donkey trespassing on my green,' said"
766 "my aunt, with emphasis, 'there was one this afternoon at four o'clock."
766 "A cold feeling came over me from head to foot, and I know it was a"
766 "donkey!'"
766 ""
766 "I tried to comfort her on this point, but she rejected consolation."
766 ""
766 "'It was a donkey,' said my aunt; 'and it was the one with the stumpy"
766 "tail which that Murdering sister of a woman rode, when she came to my"
766 "house.' This had been, ever since, the only name my aunt knew for Miss"
766 "Murdstone. 'If there is any Donkey in Dover, whose audacity it is harder"
766 "to me to bear than another's, that,' said my aunt, striking the table,"
766 "'is the animal!'"
766 ""
766 "Janet ventured to suggest that my aunt might be disturbing herself"
766 "unnecessarily, and that she believed the donkey in question was then"
766 "engaged in the sand-and-gravel line of business, and was not available"
766 "for purposes of trespass. But my aunt wouldn't hear of it."
766 ""
766 "Supper was comfortably served and hot, though my aunt's rooms were very"
766 "high up--whether that she might have more stone stairs for her money, or"
766 "might be nearer to the door in the roof, I don't know--and consisted of"
766 "a roast fowl, a steak, and some vegetables, to all of which I did ample"
766 "justice, and which were all excellent. But my aunt had her own ideas"
766 "concerning London provision, and ate but little."
766 ""
766 "'I suppose this unfortunate fowl was born and brought up in a cellar,'"
766 "said my aunt, 'and never took the air except on a hackney coach-stand. I"
766 "hope the steak may be beef, but I don't believe it. Nothing's genuine in"
766 "the place, in my opinion, but the dirt.'"
766 ""
766 "'Don't you think the fowl may have come out of the country, aunt?' I"
766 "hinted."
766 ""
766 "'Certainly not,' returned my aunt. 'It would be no pleasure to a London"
766 "tradesman to sell anything which was what he pretended it was.'"
766 ""
766 "I did not venture to controvert this opinion, but I made a good supper,"
766 "which it greatly satisfied her to see me do. When the table was cleared,"
766 "Janet assisted her to arrange her hair, to put on her nightcap, which"
766 "was of a smarter construction than usual ('in case of fire', my aunt"
766 "said), and to fold her gown back over her knees, these being her usual"
766 "preparations for warming herself before going to bed. I then made her,"
766 "according to certain established regulations from which no deviation,"
766 "however slight, could ever be permitted, a glass of hot wine and"
766 "water, and a slice of toast cut into long thin strips. With these"
766 "accompaniments we were left alone to finish the evening, my aunt sitting"
766 "opposite to me drinking her wine and water; soaking her strips of toast"
766 "in it, one by one, before eating them; and looking benignantly on me,"
766 "from among the borders of her nightcap."
766 ""
766 "'Well, Trot,' she began, 'what do you think of the proctor plan? Or have"
766 "you not begun to think about it yet?'"
766 ""
766 "'I have thought a good deal about it, my dear aunt, and I have talked a"
766 "good deal about it with Steerforth. I like it very much indeed. I like"
766 "it exceedingly.'"

766 "'Come!' said my aunt. 'That's cheering!'"
766 ""
766 "'I have only one difficulty, aunt.'"
766 ""
766 "'Say what it is, Trot,' she returned."
766 ""
766 "'Why, I want to ask, aunt, as this seems, from what I understand, to"
766 "be a limited profession, whether my entrance into it would not be very"
766 "expensive?'"
766 ""
766 "'It will cost,' returned my aunt, 'to article you, just a thousand"
766 "pounds.'"
766 ""
766 "'Now, my dear aunt,' said I, drawing my chair nearer, 'I am uneasy in"
766 "my mind about that. It's a large sum of money. You have expended a"
766 "great deal on my education, and have always been as liberal to me in all"
766 "things as it was possible to be. You have been the soul of generosity."
766 "Surely there are some ways in which I might begin life with hardly any"
766 "outlay, and yet begin with a good hope of getting on by resolution and"
766 "exertion. Are you sure that it would not be better to try that course?"
766 "Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and that"
766 "it is right that it should be so expended? I only ask you, my second"
766 "mother, to consider. Are you certain?'"

766 "'Trot, my child, if I have any object in life, it is to provide for"
766 "your being a good, a sensible, and a happy man. I am bent upon it--so is"

766 "on the subject. Its sagacity is wonderful. But no one knows the"
766 "resources of that man's intellect, except myself!'"

766 ""

766 "upon the present. Perhaps I might have been better friends with your"
766 "poor father. Perhaps I might have been better friends with that poor"
766 "child your mother, even after your sister Betsey Trotwood disappointed"
766 "me. When you came to me, a little runaway boy, all dusty and way-worn,"
766 "perhaps I thought so. From that time until now, Trot, you have ever been"
766 "a credit to me and a pride and a pleasure. I have no other claim upon"
766 "my means; at least'--here to my surprise she hesitated, and was"
766 "confused--'no, I have no other claim upon my means--and you are my"
766 "adopted child. Only be a loving child to me in my age, and bear with my"
766 "whims and fancies; and you will do more for an old woman whose prime of"

766 "that old woman did for you.'"

766 "It was the first time I had heard my aunt refer to her past history."

766 "anything could."

766 "'All is agreed and understood between us, now, Trot,' said my aunt,"

766 "We had a long chat by the fire before we went to bed. I slept in a room"
766 "on the same floor with my aunt's, and was a little disturbed in the"
766 "course of the night by her knocking at my door as often as she was"
766 "agitated by a distant sound of hackney-coaches or market-carts, and"
766 "inquiring, 'if I heard the engines?' But towards morning she slept"
766 "better, and suffered me to do so too."

766 "At about mid-day, we set out for the office of Messrs Spenlow and"

766 "few paces, and called a hackney-chariot which was passing empty. Almost"
766 "before I could let down the steps, my aunt sprang in, I don't know how,"
766 "and the man followed. She waved her hand to me to go away, so earnestly,"
766 "that, all confounded as I was, I turned from them at once. In doing so,"
766 "I heard her say to the coachman, 'Drive anywhere! Drive straight on!'"

766 "nature of his hold upon my aunt could possibly be, I was quite unable"

766 "She had not yet sufficiently recovered from her agitation to be quite"
766 "prepared for the visit we had to make. She desired me to get into the"

766 "while. She said no more, except, 'My dear child, never ask me what"
766 "it was, and don't refer to it,' until she had perfectly regained her"
766 "composure, when she told me she was quite herself now, and we might get"
766 "out. On her giving me her purse to pay the driver, I found that all the"

766 "Doctors' Commons was approached by a little low archway. Before we had"

766 "and narrow ways brought us to the sky-lighted offices of Spenlow and"
766 "Jorkins; in the vestibule of which temple, accessible to pilgrims"
766 "without the ceremony of knocking, three or four clerks were at work as"
766 "copyists. One of these, a little dry man, sitting by himself, who wore"
766 "a stiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread, rose to"

766 "old-fashioned and dusty; and the green baize on the top of the"
766 "writing-table had lost all its colour, and was as withered and pale as"
766 "an old pauper. There were a great many bundles of papers on it, some"
766 "endorsed as Allegations, and some (to my surprise) as Libels, and some"
766 "as being in the Consistory Court, and some in the Arches Court, and some"
766 "in the Prerogative Court, and some in the Admiralty Court, and some in"
766 "the Delegates' Court; giving me occasion to wonder much, how many Courts"
766 "there might be in the gross, and how long it would take to understand"
766 "them all. Besides these, there were sundry immense manuscript Books"
766 "of Evidence taken on affidavit, strongly bound, and tied together in"
766 "massive sets, a set to each cause, as if every cause were a history in"
766 "ten or twenty volumes. All this looked tolerably expensive, I thought,"

766 "whiskers, which were accurately curled. His gold watch-chain was so"
766 "massive, that a fancy came across me, that he ought to have a sinewy"
766 "golden arm, to draw it out with, like those which are put up over the"
766 "goldbeaters' shops. He was got up with such care, and was so stiff, that"
766 "he could hardly bend himself; being obliged, when he glanced at some"

766 "of the clerks poking one another with their pens to point me out."
766 ""
766 "We arrived at Lincoln's Inn Fields without any new adventures, except"
766 "encountering an unlucky donkey in a costermonger's cart, who suggested"
766 "painful associations to my aunt. We had another long talk about my"
766 "plans, when we were safely housed; and as I knew she was anxious to"
766 "get home, and, between fire, food, and pickpockets, could never be"
766 "considered at her ease for half-an-hour in London, I urged her not to be"
766 "uncomfortable on my account, but to leave me to take care of myself."
766 ""
766 "'I have not been here a week tomorrow, without considering that too, my"
766 "dear,' she returned. 'There is a furnished little set of chambers to be"
766 "let in the Adelphi, Trot, which ought to suit you to a marvel.'"
766 ""
766 "With this brief introduction, she produced from her pocket an"
766 "advertisement, carefully cut out of a newspaper, setting forth that in"
766 "Buckingham Street in the Adelphi there was to be let furnished, with a"
766 "view of the river, a singularly desirable, and compact set of chambers,"
766 "forming a genteel residence for a young gentleman, a member of one"
766 "of the Inns of Court, or otherwise, with immediate possession. Terms"
766 "moderate, and could be taken for a month only, if required."
766 ""
766 "'Why, this is the very thing, aunt!' said I, flushed with the possible"
766 "dignity of living in chambers."
766 ""
766 "'Then come,' replied my aunt, immediately resuming the bonnet she had a"
766 "minute before laid aside. 'We'll go and look at 'em.'"
766 ""
766 "Away we went. The advertisement directed us to apply to Mrs. Crupp"
766 "on the premises, and we rung the area bell, which we supposed to"
766 "communicate with Mrs. Crupp. It was not until we had rung three or four"
766 "times that we could prevail on Mrs. Crupp to communicate with us, but"
766 "at last she appeared, being a stout lady with a flounce of flannel"
766 "petticoat below a nankeen gown."
766 ""
766 "'Let us see these chambers of yours, if you please, ma'am,' said my"
766 "aunt."
766 ""
766 "'For this gentleman?' said Mrs. Crupp, feeling in her pocket for her"
766 "keys."
766 ""
766 "'Yes, for my nephew,' said my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'And a sweet set they is for sich!' said Mrs. Crupp."
766 ""
766 "So we went upstairs."
766 ""
766 "They were on the top of the house--a great point with my aunt, being"
766 "near the fire-escape--and consisted of a little half-blind entry where"
766 "you could see hardly anything, a little stone-blind pantry where you"
766 "could see nothing at all, a sitting-room, and a bedroom. The furniture"
766 "was rather faded, but quite good enough for me; and, sure enough, the"
766 "river was outside the windows."
766 ""
766 "As I was delighted with the place, my aunt and Mrs. Crupp withdrew into"
766 "the pantry to discuss the terms, while I remained on the sitting-room"
766 "sofa, hardly daring to think it possible that I could be destined to"
766 "live in such a noble residence. After a single combat of some duration"
766 "they returned, and I saw, to my joy, both in Mrs. Crupp's countenance"
766 "and in my aunt's, that the deed was done."
766 ""
766 "'Is it the last occupant's furniture?' inquired my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'Yes, it is, ma'am,' said Mrs. Crupp."
766 ""
766 "'What's become of him?' asked my aunt."
766 ""
766 "Mrs. Crupp was taken with a troublesome cough, in the midst of which"
766 "she articulated with much difficulty. 'He was took ill here, ma'am,"
766 "and--ugh! ugh! ugh! dear me!--and he died!'"
766 ""
766 "'Hey! What did he die of?' asked my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'Well, ma'am, he died of drink,' said Mrs. Crupp, in confidence. 'And"
766 "smoke.'"
766 ""
766 "'Smoke? You don't mean chimneys?' said my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'No, ma'am,' returned Mrs. Crupp. 'Cigars and pipes.'"
766 ""
766 "'That's not catching, Trot, at any rate,' remarked my aunt, turning to"
766 "me."
766 ""
766 "'No, indeed,' said I."
766 ""
766 "In short, my aunt, seeing how enraptured I was with the premises, took"
766 "them for a month, with leave to remain for twelve months when that"
766 "time was out. Mrs. Crupp was to find linen, and to cook; every other"
766 "necessary was already provided; and Mrs. Crupp expressly intimated that"
766 "she should always yearn towards me as a son. I was to take possession"
766 "the day after tomorrow, and Mrs. Crupp said, thank Heaven she had now"
766 "found summun she could care for!"
766 ""
766 "On our way back, my aunt informed me how she confidently trusted that"
766 "the life I was now to lead would make me firm and self-reliant, which"
766 "was all I wanted. She repeated this several times next day, in the"
766 "intervals of our arranging for the transmission of my clothes and books"
766 "from Mr. Wickfield's; relative to which, and to all my late holiday, I"
766 "wrote a long letter to Agnes, of which my aunt took charge, as she was"
766 "to leave on the succeeding day. Not to lengthen these particulars, I"
766 "need only add, that she made a handsome provision for all my"
766 "possible wants during my month of trial; that Steerforth, to my great"
766 "disappointment and hers too, did not make his appearance before she went"
766 "away; that I saw her safely seated in the Dover coach, exulting in the"
766 "coming discomfiture of the vagrant donkeys, with Janet at her side; and"
766 "that when the coach was gone, I turned my face to the Adelphi, pondering"
766 "on the old days when I used to roam about its subterranean arches, and"
766 "on the happy changes which had brought me to the surface."

766 "It was a wonderfully fine thing to have that lofty castle to myself, and"
766 "to feel, when I shut my outer door, like Robinson Crusoe, when he had"
766 "got into his fortification, and pulled his ladder up after him. It was a"
766 "wonderfully fine thing to walk about town with the key of my house in my"
766 "pocket, and to know that I could ask any fellow to come home, and make"
766 "quite sure of its being inconvenient to nobody, if it were not so to me."
766 "It was a wonderfully fine thing to let myself in and out, and to come"
766 "and go without a word to anyone, and to ring Mrs. Crupp up, gasping,"
766 "from the depths of the earth, when I wanted her--and when she was"
766 "disposed to come. All this, I say, was wonderfully fine; but I must say,"
766 "too, that there were times when it was very dreary."
766 ""
766 "It was fine in the morning, particularly in the fine mornings. It looked"
766 "a very fresh, free life, by daylight: still fresher, and more free, by"
766 "sunlight. But as the day declined, the life seemed to go down too. I"
766 "don't know how it was; it seldom looked well by candle-light. I wanted"
766 "somebody to talk to, then. I missed Agnes. I found a tremendous blank,"
766 "in the place of that smiling repository of my confidence. Mrs. Crupp"
766 "appeared to be a long way off. I thought about my predecessor, who had"
766 "died of drink and smoke; and I could have wished he had been so good as"
766 "to live, and not bother me with his decease."
766 ""
766 "After two days and nights, I felt as if I had lived there for a year,"

766 ""
766 "Steerforth not yet appearing, which induced me to apprehend that he must"
766 "be ill, I left the Commons early on the third day, and walked out to"
766 "Highgate. Mrs. Steerforth was very glad to see me, and said that he had"
766 "gone away with one of his Oxford friends to see another who lived near"
766 "St. Albans, but that she expected him to return tomorrow. I was so fond"
766 "of him, that I felt quite jealous of his Oxford friends."
766 ""
766 "As she pressed me to stay to dinner, I remained, and I believe we talked"
766 "about nothing but him all day. I told her how much the people liked him"
766 "at Yarmouth, and what a delightful companion he had been. Miss Dartle"
766 "was full of hints and mysterious questions, but took a great interest"
766 "in all our proceedings there, and said, 'Was it really though?' and so"
766 "forth, so often, that she got everything out of me she wanted to know."
766 "Her appearance was exactly what I have described it, when I first saw"
766 "her; but the society of the two ladies was so agreeable, and came so"
766 "natural to me, that I felt myself falling a little in love with her. I"
766 "could not help thinking, several times in the course of the evening, and"
766 "particularly when I walked home at night, what delightful company she"
766 "would be in Buckingham Street."
766 ""
766 "I was taking my coffee and roll in the morning, before going to the"
766 "Commons--and I may observe in this place that it is surprising how"
766 "much coffee Mrs. Crupp used, and how weak it was, considering--when"
766 "Steerforth himself walked in, to my unbounded joy."
766 ""
766 "'My dear Steerforth,' cried I, 'I began to think I should never see you"
766 "again!'"

766 "'I was carried off, by force of arms,' said Steerforth, 'the very next"
766 "morning after I got home. Why, Daisy, what a rare old bachelor you are"
766 "here!'"
766 ""
766 "I showed him over the establishment, not omitting the pantry, with no"
766 "little pride, and he commended it highly. 'I tell you what, old boy,' he"
766 "added, 'I shall make quite a town-house of this place, unless you give"
766 "me notice to quit.'"
766 ""
766 "This was a delightful hearing. I told him if he waited for that, he"
766 "would have to wait till doomsday."
766 ""
766 "'But you shall have some breakfast!' said I, with my hand on the"
766 "bell-rope, 'and Mrs. Crupp shall make you some fresh coffee, and I'll"

766 "inconvenience you. You had better come and dine with us somewhere.'"

766 "I would not by any means consent to this, for it occurred to me that I"
766 "really ought to have a little house-warming, and that there never"
766 "could be a better opportunity. I had a new pride in my rooms after"
766 "his approval of them, and burned with a desire to develop their utmost"
766 "resources. I therefore made him promise positively in the names of his"
766 "two friends, and we appointed six o'clock as the dinner-hour."
766 ""
766 "When he was gone, I rang for Mrs. Crupp, and acquainted her with my"
766 "desperate design. Mrs. Crupp said, in the first place, of course it was"
766 "well known she couldn't be expected to wait, but she knew a handy young"
766 "man, who she thought could be prevailed upon to do it, and whose terms"
766 "would be five shillings, and what I pleased. I said, certainly we would"
766 "have him. Next Mrs. Crupp said it was clear she couldn't be in two"
766 "places at once (which I felt to be reasonable), and that 'a young gal'"
766 "stationed in the pantry with a bedroom candle, there never to desist"
766 "from washing plates, would be indispensable. I said, what would be"
766 "the expense of this young female? and Mrs. Crupp said she supposed"
766 "eighteenpence would neither make me nor break me. I said I supposed not;"
766 "and THAT was settled. Then Mrs. Crupp said, Now about the dinner."
766 ""
766 "It was a remarkable instance of want of forethought on the part of the"
766 "ironmonger who had made Mrs. Crupp's kitchen fireplace, that it was"
766 "capable of cooking nothing but chops and mashed potatoes. As to a"
766 "fish-kittle, Mrs. Crupp said, well! would I only come and look at the"
766 "range? She couldn't say fairer than that. Would I come and look at"
766 "it? As I should not have been much the wiser if I HAD looked at it, I"
766 "declined, and said, 'Never mind fish.' But Mrs. Crupp said, Don't say"
766 "that; oysters was in, why not them? So THAT was settled. Mrs. Crupp"
766 "then said what she would recommend would be this. A pair of hot"
766 "roast fowls--from the pastry-cook's; a dish of stewed beef, with"
766 "vegetables--from the pastry-cook's; two little corner things, as a"
766 "raised pie and a dish of kidneys--from the pastrycook's; a tart, and (if"
766 "I liked) a shape of jelly--from the pastrycook's. This, Mrs. Crupp said,"
766 "would leave her at full liberty to concentrate her mind on the potatoes,"
766 "and to serve up the cheese and celery as she could wish to see it done."
766 ""
766 "I acted on Mrs. Crupp's opinion, and gave the order at the pastry-cook's"
766 "myself. Walking along the Strand, afterwards, and observing a hard"
766 "mottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop, which resembled"
766 "marble, but was labelled 'Mock Turtle', I went in and bought a slab of"
766 "it, which I have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed for"
766 "fifteen people. This preparation, Mrs. Crupp, after some difficulty,"
766 "consented to warm up; and it shrunk so much in a liquid state, that we"
766 "found it what Steerforth called 'rather a tight fit' for four."
766 ""
766 "These preparations happily completed, I bought a little dessert in"
766 "Covent Garden Market, and gave a rather extensive order at a retail"
766 "wine-merchant's in that vicinity. When I came home in the afternoon, and"
766 "saw the bottles drawn up in a square on the pantry floor, they looked"
766 "so numerous (though there were two missing, which made Mrs. Crupp very"
766 "uncomfortable), that I was absolutely frightened at them."
766 ""
766 "One of Steerforth's friends was named Grainger, and the other Markham."
766 "They were both very gay and lively fellows; Grainger, something older"
766 "than Steerforth; Markham, youthful-looking, and I should say not"
766 "more than twenty. I observed that the latter always spoke of himself"
766 "indefinitely, as 'a man', and seldom or never in the first person"
766 "singular."
766 ""
766 "'A man might get on very well here, Mr. Copperfield,' said"
766 "Markham--meaning himself."

766 "'It's not a bad situation,' said I, 'and the rooms are really"
766 "commodious.'"

766 "'I hope you have both brought appetites with you?' said Steerforth."
766 ""
766 "'Upon my honour,' returned Markham, 'town seems to sharpen a man's"
766 "appetite. A man is hungry all day long. A man is perpetually eating.'"
766 ""
766 "Being a little embarrassed at first, and feeling much too young to"
766 "preside, I made Steerforth take the head of the table when dinner was"
766 "announced, and seated myself opposite to him. Everything was very good;"
766 "we did not spare the wine; and he exerted himself so brilliantly to make"
766 "the thing pass off well, that there was no pause in our festivity. I was"
766 "not quite such good company during dinner as I could have wished to be,"
766 "for my chair was opposite the door, and my attention was distracted by"
766 "observing that the handy young man went out of the room very often, and"
766 "that his shadow always presented itself, immediately afterwards, on the"
766 "wall of the entry, with a bottle at its mouth. The 'young gal' likewise"
766 "occasioned me some uneasiness: not so much by neglecting to wash the"
766 "plates, as by breaking them. For being of an inquisitive disposition,"
766 "and unable to confine herself (as her positive instructions were) to the"
766 "pantry, she was constantly peering in at us, and constantly imagining"
766 "herself detected; in which belief, she several times retired upon the"
766 "plates (with which she had carefully paved the floor), and did a great"
766 "deal of destruction."
766 ""
766 "These, however, were small drawbacks, and easily forgotten when the"
766 "cloth was cleared, and the dessert put on the table; at which period of"
766 "the entertainment the handy young man was discovered to be speechless."
766 "Giving him private directions to seek the society of Mrs. Crupp, and"
766 "to remove the 'young gal' to the basement also, I abandoned myself to"
766 "enjoyment."
766 ""
766 "I began, by being singularly cheerful and light-hearted; all sorts of"
766 "half-forgotten things to talk about, came rushing into my mind, and made"
766 "me hold forth in a most unwonted manner. I laughed heartily at my own"
766 "jokes, and everybody else's; called Steerforth to order for not passing"
766 "the wine; made several engagements to go to Oxford; announced that"
766 "I meant to have a dinner-party exactly like that, once a week, until"
766 "further notice; and madly took so much snuff out of Grainger's box, that"
766 "I was obliged to go into the pantry, and have a private fit of sneezing"
766 "ten minutes long."
766 ""
766 "I went on, by passing the wine faster and faster yet, and continually"
766 "starting up with a corkscrew to open more wine, long before any was"
766 "needed. I proposed Steerforth's health. I said he was my dearest friend,"
766 "the protector of my boyhood, and the companion of my prime. I said I was"
766 "delighted to propose his health. I said I owed him more obligations than"
766 "I could ever repay, and held him in a higher admiration than I could"
766 "ever express. I finished by saying, 'I'll give you Steerforth! God bless"
766 "him! Hurrah!' We gave him three times three, and another, and a good one"
766 "to finish with. I broke my glass in going round the table to shake"

766 "'Steerforth--you'retheguidingstarofmyexistence.'"

766 "depressed with care'. He said, when he had sung it, he would give us"
766 "'Woman!' I took objection to that, and I couldn't allow it. I said"
766 "it was not a respectful way of proposing the toast, and I would never"
766 "permit that toast to be drunk in my house otherwise than as 'The"
766 "Ladies!' I was very high with him, mainly I think because I saw"
766 "Steerforth and Grainger laughing at me--or at him--or at both of us. He"
766 "said a man was not to be dictated to. I said a man was. He said a man"
766 "was not to be insulted, then. I said he was right there--never under"
766 "my roof, where the Lares were sacred, and the laws of hospitality"
766 "paramount. He said it was no derogation from a man's dignity to confess"
766 "that I was a devilish good fellow. I instantly proposed his health."

766 "saying, 'Why did you try to smoke? You might have known you couldn't"
766 "do it.' Now, somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features in the"
766 "looking-glass. That was I too. I was very pale in the looking-glass;"

766 "opposite--all sitting in a mist, and a long way off. The theatre? To"
766 "be sure. The very thing. Come along! But they must excuse me if I saw"

766 "the bottom, somebody fell, and rolled down. Somebody else said it was"

766 "him) whether to take the money for me or not. Shortly afterwards, we"
766 "were very high up in a very hot theatre, looking down into a large pit,"
766 "that seemed to me to smoke; the people with whom it was crammed were so"
766 "indistinct. There was a great stage, too, looking very clean and"

766 "opportunities of being his companion. Oh, Trotwood!' cried Agnes,"
766 "putting her hands before her face, as her tears started on it, 'I almost"

766 "'Well,' returned Mr. Waterbrook, pursing up his mouth, and playing with"
766 "his watch-chain, in a comfortable, prosperous sort of way. 'I should say"
766 "he was one of those men who stand in their own light. Yes, I should say"
766 "he would never, for example, be worth five hundred pound. Traddles was"
766 "recommended to me by a professional friend. Oh yes. Yes. He has a kind"
766 "of talent for drawing briefs, and stating a case in writing, plainly. I"
766 "am able to throw something in Traddles's way, in the course of the year;"
766 "something--for him--considerable. Oh yes. Yes.'"
766 ""
766 "I was much impressed by the extremely comfortable and satisfied manner"
766 "in which Mr. Waterbrook delivered himself of this little word 'Yes',"
766 "every now and then. There was wonderful expression in it. It completely"
766 "conveyed the idea of a man who had been born, not to say with a silver"
766 "spoon, but with a scaling-ladder, and had gone on mounting all the"
766 "heights of life one after another, until now he looked, from the top of"
766 "the fortifications, with the eye of a philosopher and a patron, on the"
766 "people down in the trenches."

766 "My reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was"
766 "announced. Mr. Waterbrook went down with Hamlet's aunt. Mr. Henry Spiker"
766 "took Mrs. Waterbrook. Agnes, whom I should have liked to take myself,"
766 "was given to a simpering fellow with weak legs. Uriah, Traddles, and I,"
766 "as the junior part of the company, went down last, how we could. I was"
766 "not so vexed at losing Agnes as I might have been, since it gave me"
766 "an opportunity of making myself known to Traddles on the stairs, who"
766 "greeted me with great fervour; while Uriah writhed with such obtrusive"
766 "satisfaction and self-abasement, that I could gladly have pitched"
766 "him over the banisters. Traddles and I were separated at table, being"
766 "billeted in two remote corners: he in the glare of a red velvet lady;"
766 "I, in the gloom of Hamlet's aunt. The dinner was very long, and the"
766 "conversation was about the Aristocracy--and Blood. Mrs. Waterbrook"
766 "repeatedly told us, that if she had a weakness, it was Blood."

766 "It occurred to me several times that we should have got on better, if we"
766 "had not been quite so genteel. We were so exceedingly genteel, that our"
766 "scope was very limited. A Mr. and Mrs. Gulpidge were of the party, who"
766 "had something to do at second-hand (at least, Mr. Gulpidge had) with"
766 "the law business of the Bank; and what with the Bank, and what with"
766 "the Treasury, we were as exclusive as the Court Circular. To mend the"
766 "matter, Hamlet's aunt had the family failing of indulging in soliloquy,"
766 "and held forth in a desultory manner, by herself, on every topic that"
766 "was introduced. These were few enough, to be sure; but as we always fell"
766 "back upon Blood, she had as wide a field for abstract speculation as her"
766 "nephew himself."

766 "'Oh! There is nothing,' observed Hamlet's aunt, 'so satisfactory to one!"
766 "There is nothing that is so much one's beau-ideal of--of all that sort"
766 "of thing, speaking generally. There are some low minds (not many, I am"
766 "happy to believe, but there are some) that would prefer to do what I"
766 "should call bow down before idols. Positively Idols! Before service,"
766 "intellect, and so on. But these are intangible points. Blood is not so."
766 "We see Blood in a nose, and we know it. We meet with it in a chin, and"
766 "we say, \"There it is! That's Blood!\" It is an actual matter of fact. We"
766 "point it out. It admits of no doubt.'"

766 "board with an imbecile smile, 'we can't forego Blood, you know. We must"

766 "behind their station, perhaps, in point of education and behaviour, and"

766 "entered into a defensive alliance against us, the common enemy, and"

766 "involved.'"
766 ""
766 "Mr. Waterbrook was only too happy, as it appeared to me, to have such"
766 "interests, and such names, even hinted at, across his table. He assumed"
766 "an expression of gloomy intelligence (though I am persuaded he knew"
766 "no more about the discussion than I did), and highly approved of the"
766 "discretion that had been observed. Mr. Spiker, after the receipt of such"
766 "a confidence, naturally desired to favour his friend with a confidence"
766 "of his own; therefore the foregoing dialogue was succeeded by another,"

766 "in which the surprise came round to Mr. Spiker's turn again, and so on,"
766 "turn and turn about. All this time we, the outsiders, remained oppressed"
766 "by the tremendous interests involved in the conversation; and our"
766 "host regarded us with pride, as the victims of a salutary awe and"
766 "astonishment. I was very glad indeed to get upstairs to Agnes, and to"
766 "talk with her in a corner, and to introduce Traddles to her, who was"
766 "shy, but agreeable, and the same good-natured creature still. As he"
766 "was obliged to leave early, on account of going away next morning for"
766 "a month, I had not nearly so much conversation with him as I could have"
766 "wished; but we exchanged addresses, and promised ourselves the pleasure"
766 "of another meeting when he should come back to town. He was greatly"
766 "interested to hear that I knew Steerforth, and spoke of him with such"
766 "warmth that I made him tell Agnes what he thought of him. But Agnes only"
766 "looked at me the while, and very slightly shook her head when only I"

766 ""
766 "As she was not among people with whom I believed she could be very much"

766 "so soon. This caused me to remain until all the company were gone."
766 "Conversing with her, and hearing her sing, was such a delightful"
766 "reminder to me of my happy life in the grave old house she had made so"
766 "beautiful, that I could have remained there half the night; but, having"
766 "no excuse for staying any longer, when the lights of Mr. Waterbrook's"
766 "society were all snuffed out, I took my leave very much against my"
766 "inclination. I felt then, more than ever, that she was my better Angel;"
766 "and if I thought of her sweet face and placid smile, as though they had"
766 "shone on me from some removed being, like an Angel, I hope I thought no"

766 "he, returning to Canterbury by the same conveyance. It was some small"
766 "satisfaction to me to observe his spare, short-waisted, high-shouldered,"
766 "mulberry-coloured great-coat perched up, in company with an umbrella"

766 "In the state of trouble into which his disclosure by my fire had thrown"

766 "and as owing him a great debt she ardently desired to pay. I had no"
766 "consolation in seeing how different she was from this detestable Rufus"
766 "with the mulberry-coloured great-coat, for I felt that in the very"
766 "difference between them, in the self-denial of her pure soul and the"
766 "sordid baseness of his, the greatest danger lay. All this, doubtless, he"
766 "knew thoroughly, and had, in his cunning, considered well."

766 "that I could as soon have injured her, as given her any warning of what"
766 "impended. Thus it was that we parted without explanation: she waving"
766 "her hand and smiling farewell from the coach window; her evil genius"
766 "writhing on the roof, as if he had her in his clutches and triumphed."

766 "I could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time. When"
766 "Agnes wrote to tell me of her safe arrival, I was as miserable as when"

766 "subject was sure to present itself, and all my uneasiness was sure to be"

766 "I had ample leisure to refine upon my uneasiness: for Steerforth was at"

766 "very much alone. I believe I had at this time some lurking distrust of"
766 "Steerforth. I wrote to him most affectionately in reply to his, but I"
766 "think I was glad, upon the whole, that he could not come to London just"
766 "then. I suspect the truth to be, that the influence of Agnes was upon"
766 "me, undisturbed by the sight of him; and that it was the more powerful"
766 "with me, because she had so large a share in my thoughts and interest."

766 "In the meantime, days and weeks slipped away. I was articled to Spenlow"
766 "and Jorkins. I had ninety pounds a year (exclusive of my house-rent"

766 "for twelve months certain: and though I still found them dreary of an"
766 "evening, and the evenings long, I could settle down into a state of"
766 "equable low spirits, and resign myself to coffee; which I seem, on"
766 "looking back, to have taken by the gallon at about this period of my"
766 "existence. At about this time, too, I made three discoveries: first,"
766 "that Mrs. Crupp was a martyr to a curious disorder called 'the"
766 "spazzums', which was generally accompanied with inflammation of the"
766 "nose, and required to be constantly treated with peppermint; secondly,"
766 "that something peculiar in the temperature of my pantry, made the"
766 "brandy-bottles burst; thirdly, that I was alone in the world, and much"
766 "given to record that circumstance in fragments of English versification."

766 "On the day when I was articled, no festivity took place, beyond my"
766 "having sandwiches and sherry into the office for the clerks, and going"
766 "alone to the theatre at night. I went to see The Stranger, as a Doctors'"
766 "Commons sort of play, and was so dreadfully cut up, that I hardly knew"
766 "myself in my own glass when I got home. Mr. Spenlow remarked, on this"

766 "connected, but for his domestic arrangements being in some disorder,"
766 "on account of the expected return of his daughter from finishing her"
766 "education at Paris. But, he intimated that when she came home he should"

766 "ate entirely off plate and china; and another hinted at champagne being"
766 "constantly on draught, after the usual custom of table-beer. The old"
766 "clerk with the wig, whose name was Mr. Tiffey, had been down on business"
766 "several times in the course of his career, and had on each occasion"
766 "penetrated to the breakfast-parlour. He described it as an apartment of"
766 "the most sumptuous nature, and said that he had drunk brown East India"
766 "sherry there, of a quality so precious as to make a man wink. We had"
766 "an adjourned cause in the Consistory that day--about excommunicating a"
766 "baker who had been objecting in a vestry to a paving-rate--and as the"
766 "evidence was just twice the length of Robinson Crusoe, according to a"
766 "calculation I made, it was rather late in the day before we finished."
766 "However, we got him excommunicated for six weeks, and sentenced in"
766 "no end of costs; and then the baker's proctor, and the judge, and the"
766 "advocates on both sides (who were all nearly related), went out of town"
766 "together, and Mr. Spenlow and I drove away in the phaeton."
766 ""
766 "The phaeton was a very handsome affair; the horses arched their necks"
766 "and lifted up their legs as if they knew they belonged to Doctors'"

766 "points of display, and it turned out some very choice equipages then;"

766 "solicitor: being quite another sort of thing, infinitely more exclusive,"
766 "less mechanical, and more profitable. We took things much more easily"
766 "in the Commons than they could be taken anywhere else, he observed, and"
766 "that set us, as a privileged class, apart. He said it was impossible"
766 "to conceal the disagreeable fact, that we were chiefly employed by"
766 "solicitors; but he gave me to understand that they were an inferior race"
766 "of men, universally looked down upon by all proctors of any pretensions."
766 ""
766 "I asked Mr. Spenlow what he considered the best sort of professional"
766 "business? He replied, that a good case of a disputed will, where there"
766 "was a neat little estate of thirty or forty thousand pounds, was,"
766 "perhaps, the best of all. In such a case, he said, not only were there"
766 "very pretty pickings, in the way of arguments at every stage of the"
766 "proceedings, and mountains upon mountains of evidence on interrogatory"
766 "and counter-interrogatory (to say nothing of an appeal lying, first to"
766 "the Delegates, and then to the Lords), but, the costs being pretty sure"
766 "to come out of the estate at last, both sides went at it in a lively"
766 "and spirited manner, and expense was no consideration. Then, he launched"
766 "into a general eulogium on the Commons. What was to be particularly"
766 "admired (he said) in the Commons, was its compactness. It was the most"
766 "conveniently organized place in the world. It was the complete idea of"
766 "snugness. It lay in a nutshell. For example: You brought a divorce case,"
766 "or a restitution case, into the Consistory. Very good. You tried it in"
766 "the Consistory. You made a quiet little round game of it, among a family"
766 "group, and you played it out at leisure. Suppose you were not satisfied"
766 "with the Consistory, what did you do then? Why, you went into the"
766 "Arches. What was the Arches? The same court, in the same room, with the"
766 "same bar, and the same practitioners, but another judge, for there the"
766 "Consistory judge could plead any court-day as an advocate. Well, you"
766 "played your round game out again. Still you were not satisfied. Very"
766 "good. What did you do then? Why, you went to the Delegates. Who were the"
766 "Delegates? Why, the Ecclesiastical Delegates were the advocates without"
766 "any business, who had looked on at the round game when it was playing in"
766 "both courts, and had seen the cards shuffled, and cut, and played, and"
766 "had talked to all the players about it, and now came fresh, as judges,"
766 "to settle the matter to the satisfaction of everybody! Discontented"
766 "people might talk of corruption in the Commons, closeness in the"
766 "Commons, and the necessity of reforming the Commons, said Mr. Spenlow"
766 "solemnly, in conclusion; but when the price of wheat per bushel had been"
766 "highest, the Commons had been busiest; and a man might lay his hand upon"
766 "his heart, and say this to the whole world,--'Touch the Commons, and"
766 "down comes the country!'"

766 "I listened to all this with attention; and though, I must say, I had my"
766 "doubts whether the country was quite as much obliged to the Commons as"
766 "Mr. Spenlow made out, I respectfully deferred to his opinion. That"
766 "about the price of wheat per bushel, I modestly felt was too much for"
766 "my strength, and quite settled the question. I have never, to this hour,"
766 "got the better of that bushel of wheat. It has reappeared to annihilate"
766 "me, all through my life, in connexion with all kinds of subjects. I"
766 "don't know now, exactly, what it has to do with me, or what right it has"

766 ""
766 "A passing thought occurred to me that Miss Murdstone, like the pocket"

766 "What a state of mind I was in! I was jealous of everybody. I couldn't"

766 "share. When a most amiable person, with a highly polished bald head,"

766 "A mysterious voice from the end of the passage replied 'Yes.' Upon which"
766 "the youthful servant replied 'Yes.'"
766 ""
766 "'Is he at home?' said I."
766 ""
766 "Again the mysterious voice replied in the affirmative, and again the"
766 "servant echoed it. Upon this, I walked in, and in pursuance of the"
766 "servant's directions walked upstairs; conscious, as I passed the"
766 "back parlour-door, that I was surveyed by a mysterious eye, probably"
766 "belonging to the mysterious voice."

766 "When I got to the top of the stairs--the house was only a story high"
766 "above the ground floor--Traddles was on the landing to meet me. He was"
766 "delighted to see me, and gave me welcome, with great heartiness, to"
766 "his little room. It was in the front of the house, and extremely neat,"
766 "though sparely furnished. It was his only room, I saw; for there was a"
766 "sofa-bedstead in it, and his blacking-brushes and blacking were among"
766 "his books--on the top shelf, behind a dictionary. His table was covered"
766 "with papers, and he was hard at work in an old coat. I looked at"
766 "nothing, that I know of, but I saw everything, even to the prospect of"
766 "a church upon his china inkstand, as I sat down--and this, too, was a"
766 "faculty confirmed in me in the old Micawber times. Various ingenious"
766 "arrangements he had made, for the disguise of his chest of drawers,"
766 "and the accommodation of his boots, his shaving-glass, and so forth,"
766 "particularly impressed themselves upon me, as evidences of the same"
766 "Traddles who used to make models of elephants' dens in writing-paper to"
766 "put flies in; and to comfort himself under ill usage, with the memorable"
766 "works of art I have so often mentioned."
766 ""
766 "In a corner of the room was something neatly covered up with a large"
766 "white cloth. I could not make out what that was."
766 ""
766 "'Traddles,' said I, shaking hands with him again, after I had sat down,"
766 "'I am delighted to see you.'"
766 ""
766 "'I am delighted to see YOU, Copperfield,' he returned. 'I am very glad"
766 "indeed to see you. It was because I was thoroughly glad to see you when"
766 "we met in Ely Place, and was sure you were thoroughly glad to see me,"
766 "that I gave you this address instead of my address at chambers.' 'Oh!"
766 "You have chambers?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Why, I have the fourth of a room and a passage, and the fourth of a"
766 "clerk,' returned Traddles. 'Three others and myself unite to have a"
766 "set of chambers--to look business-like--and we quarter the clerk too."
766 "Half-a-crown a week he costs me.'"
766 ""
766 "His old simple character and good temper, and something of his old"
766 "unlucky fortune also, I thought, smiled at me in the smile with which he"
766 "made this explanation."
766 ""
766 "'It's not because I have the least pride, Copperfield, you understand,'"
766 "said Traddles, 'that I don't usually give my address here. It's only on"
766 "account of those who come to me, who might not like to come here. For"
766 "myself, I am fighting my way on in the world against difficulties, and"
766 "it would be ridiculous if I made a pretence of doing anything else.'"
766 ""
766 "'You are reading for the bar, Mr. Waterbrook informed me?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Why, yes,' said Traddles, rubbing his hands slowly over one another. 'I"
766 "am reading for the bar. The fact is, I have just begun to keep my terms,"
766 "after rather a long delay. It's some time since I was articled, but the"
766 "payment of that hundred pounds was a great pull. A great pull!' said"
766 "Traddles, with a wince, as if he had had a tooth out."
766 ""
766 "'Do you know what I can't help thinking of, Traddles, as I sit here"
766 "looking at you?' I asked him."
766 ""
766 "'No,' said he."
766 ""
766 "'That sky-blue suit you used to wear.'"
766 ""
766 "'Lord, to be sure!' cried Traddles, laughing. 'Tight in the arms and"
766 "legs, you know? Dear me! Well! Those were happy times, weren't they?'"
766 ""
766 "'I think our schoolmaster might have made them happier, without doing"
766 "any harm to any of us, I acknowledge,' I returned."
766 ""
766 "'Perhaps he might,' said Traddles. 'But dear me, there was a good deal"
766 "of fun going on. Do you remember the nights in the bedroom? When we used"
766 "to have the suppers? And when you used to tell the stories? Ha, ha,"
766 "ha! And do you remember when I got caned for crying about Mr. Mell? Old"
766 "Creakle! I should like to see him again, too!'"
766 ""
766 "'He was a brute to you, Traddles,' said I, indignantly; for his good"
766 "humour made me feel as if I had seen him beaten but yesterday."
766 ""
766 "'Do you think so?' returned Traddles. 'Really? Perhaps he was rather."
766 "But it's all over, a long while. Old Creakle!'"
766 ""
766 "'You were brought up by an uncle, then?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Of course I was!' said Traddles. 'The one I was always going to write"
766 "to. And always didn't, eh! Ha, ha, ha! Yes, I had an uncle then. He died"
766 "soon after I left school.'"
766 ""
766 "'Indeed!'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes. He was a retired--what do you call"
766 "it!--draper--cloth-merchant--and had made me his heir. But he didn't"
766 "like me when I grew up.'"
766 ""
766 "'Do you really mean that?' said I. He was so composed, that I fancied he"
766 "must have some other meaning."
766 ""
766 "'Oh dear, yes, Copperfield! I mean it,' replied Traddles. 'It was an"
766 "unfortunate thing, but he didn't like me at all. He said I wasn't at all"
766 "what he expected, and so he married his housekeeper.'"
766 ""
766 "'And what did you do?' I asked."
766 ""
766 "'I didn't do anything in particular,' said Traddles. 'I lived with them,"
766 "waiting to be put out in the world, until his gout unfortunately flew"
766 "to his stomach--and so he died, and so she married a young man, and so I"
766 "wasn't provided for.'"
766 ""
766 "'Did you get nothing, Traddles, after all?'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh dear, yes!' said Traddles. 'I got fifty pounds. I had never been"
766 "brought up to any profession, and at first I was at a loss what to"
766 "do for myself. However, I began, with the assistance of the son of a"
766 "professional man, who had been to Salem House--Yawler, with his nose on"
766 "one side. Do you recollect him?'"
766 ""
766 "No. He had not been there with me; all the noses were straight in my"
766 "day."
766 ""
766 "'It don't matter,' said Traddles. 'I began, by means of his assistance,"
766 "to copy law writings. That didn't answer very well; and then I began to"
766 "state cases for them, and make abstracts, and that sort of work. For"
766 "I am a plodding kind of fellow, Copperfield, and had learnt the way of"
766 "doing such things pithily. Well! That put it in my head to enter myself"
766 "as a law student; and that ran away with all that was left of the fifty"
766 "pounds. Yawler recommended me to one or two other offices, however--Mr."
766 "Waterbrook's for one--and I got a good many jobs. I was fortunate"
766 "enough, too, to become acquainted with a person in the publishing way,"
766 "who was getting up an Encyclopaedia, and he set me to work; and, indeed'"
766 "(glancing at his table), 'I am at work for him at this minute. I am not"
766 "a bad compiler, Copperfield,' said Traddles, preserving the same air of"
766 "cheerful confidence in all he said, 'but I have no invention at all; not"
766 "a particle. I suppose there never was a young man with less originality"
766 "than I have.'"
766 ""
766 "As Traddles seemed to expect that I should assent to this as a matter"
766 "of course, I nodded; and he went on, with the same sprightly patience--I"
766 "can find no better expression--as before."
766 ""
766 "'So, by little and little, and not living high, I managed to scrape up"
766 "the hundred pounds at last,' said Traddles; 'and thank Heaven that's"
766 "paid--though it was--though it certainly was,' said Traddles, wincing"
766 "again as if he had had another tooth out, 'a pull. I am living by the"
766 "sort of work I have mentioned, still, and I hope, one of these days, to"
766 "get connected with some newspaper: which would almost be the making of"
766 "my fortune. Now, Copperfield, you are so exactly what you used to"
766 "be, with that agreeable face, and it's so pleasant to see you, that I"
766 "sha'n't conceal anything. Therefore you must know that I am engaged.'"
766 ""
766 "Engaged! Oh, Dora!"
766 ""
766 "'She is a curate's daughter,' said Traddles; 'one of ten, down in"
766 "Devonshire. Yes!' For he saw me glance, involuntarily, at the prospect"
766 "on the inkstand. 'That's the church! You come round here to the left,"
766 "out of this gate,' tracing his finger along the inkstand, 'and exactly"
766 "where I hold this pen, there stands the house--facing, you understand,"
766 "towards the church.'"
766 ""
766 "The delight with which he entered into these particulars, did not fully"
766 "present itself to me until afterwards; for my selfish thoughts were"
766 "making a ground-plan of Mr. Spenlow's house and garden at the same"
766 "moment."
766 ""
766 "'She is such a dear girl!' said Traddles; 'a little older than me, but"
766 "the dearest girl! I told you I was going out of town? I have been down"
766 "there. I walked there, and I walked back, and I had the most delightful"
766 "time! I dare say ours is likely to be a rather long engagement, but our"
766 "motto is \"Wait and hope!\" We always say that. \"Wait and hope,\" we always"
766 "say. And she would wait, Copperfield, till she was sixty--any age you"
766 "can mention--for me!'"
766 ""
766 "Traddles rose from his chair, and, with a triumphant smile, put his hand"
766 "upon the white cloth I had observed."
766 ""
766 "'However,' he said, 'it's not that we haven't made a beginning towards"
766 "housekeeping. No, no; we have begun. We must get on by degrees, but we"
766 "have begun. Here,' drawing the cloth off with great pride and care, 'are"
766 "two pieces of furniture to commence with. This flower-pot and stand,"
766 "she bought herself. You put that in a parlour window,' said Traddles,"
766 "falling a little back from it to survey it with the greater admiration,"
766 "'with a plant in it, and--and there you are! This little round table"
766 "with the marble top (it's two feet ten in circumference), I bought. You"
766 "want to lay a book down, you know, or somebody comes to see you or your"
766 "wife, and wants a place to stand a cup of tea upon, and--and there you"
766 "are again!' said Traddles. 'It's an admirable piece of workmanship--firm"
766 "as a rock!' I praised them both, highly, and Traddles replaced the"
766 "covering as carefully as he had removed it."
766 ""
766 "'It's not a great deal towards the furnishing,' said Traddles, 'but"
766 "it's something. The table-cloths, and pillow-cases, and articles of"
766 "that kind, are what discourage me most, Copperfield. So does"
766 "the ironmongery--candle-boxes, and gridirons, and that sort of"
766 "necessaries--because those things tell, and mount up. However, \"wait and"
766 "hope!\" And I assure you she's the dearest girl!'"

766 "'In the meantime,' said Traddles, coming back to his chair; 'and this is"
766 "the end of my prosing about myself, I get on as well as I can. I don't"
766 "make much, but I don't spend much. In general, I board with the people"
766 "downstairs, who are very agreeable people indeed. Both Mr. and Mrs."
766 "Micawber have seen a good deal of life, and are excellent company.'"

766 "experience in Windsor Terrace, and which nobody but Mr. Micawber could"

766 "their being my old friends. I begged Traddles to ask his landlord"
766 "to walk up. Traddles accordingly did so, over the banister; and Mr."
766 "Micawber, not a bit changed--his tights, his stick, his shirt-collar,"
766 "and his eye-glass, all the same as ever--came into the room with a"

766 "'I beg your pardon, Mr. Traddles,' said Mr. Micawber, with the old roll"
766 "in his voice, as he checked himself in humming a soft tune. 'I was not"
766 "aware that there was any individual, alien to this tenement, in your"
766 "sanctum.'"
766 ""

766 "presently revived, however, and was really pleased to see me. We had"
766 "half-an-hour's talk, all together; and I asked her about the twins,"

766 "moment. I never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself amid the fragrance"
766 "of lemon-peel and sugar, the odour of burning rum, and the steam of"
766 "boiling water, as Mr. Micawber did that afternoon. It was wonderful to"

766 "appearance of the gravy, forasmuch as the 'young gal' had dropped it all"
766 "upon the stairs--where it remained, by the by, in a long train, until it"

766 "satisfied that Mr. and Mrs. Micawber could not have enjoyed the"
766 "feast more, if they had sold a bed to provide it. Traddles laughed as"
766 "heartily, almost the whole time, as he ate and worked. Indeed we all"

766 "We should not have been much discomposed, I dare say, by the appearance"

766 "alleged to have pushed the other against a pump; the handle of which"
766 "pump projecting into a school-house, which school-house was under a"
766 "gable of the church-roof, made the push an ecclesiastical offence."
766 "It was an amusing case; and sent me up to Highgate, on the box of the"

766 "Mrs. Steerforth was pleased to see me, and so was Rosa Dartle. I was"

766 "were attended by a modest little parlour-maid, with blue ribbons in her"
766 "cap, whose eye it was much more pleasant, and much less disconcerting,"
766 "to catch by accident, than the eye of that respectable man. But what I"
766 "particularly observed, before I had been half-an-hour in the house, was"
766 "the close and attentive watch Miss Dartle kept upon me; and the lurking"
766 "manner in which she seemed to compare my face with Steerforth's, and"
766 "Steerforth's with mine, and to lie in wait for something to come out"
766 "between the two. So surely as I looked towards her, did I see that eager"
766 "visage, with its gaunt black eyes and searching brow, intent on mine; or"
766 "passing suddenly from mine to Steerforth's; or comprehending both of us"
766 "at once. In this lynx-like scrutiny she was so far from faltering when"
766 "she saw I observed it, that at such a time she only fixed her piercing"
766 "look upon me with a more intent expression still. Blameless as I was,"
766 "and knew that I was, in reference to any wrong she could possibly"
766 "suspect me of, I shrunk before her strange eyes, quite unable to endure"
766 "their hungry lustre."
766 ""
766 "All day, she seemed to pervade the whole house. If I talked to"
766 "Steerforth in his room, I heard her dress rustle in the little gallery"
766 "outside. When he and I engaged in some of our old exercises on the lawn"
766 "behind the house, I saw her face pass from window to window, like a"
766 "wandering light, until it fixed itself in one, and watched us. When we"
766 "all four went out walking in the afternoon, she closed her thin hand on"
766 "my arm like a spring, to keep me back, while Steerforth and his mother"
766 "went on out of hearing: and then spoke to me."
766 ""
766 "'You have been a long time,' she said, 'without coming here. Is your"

766 ""
766 "A quick glance of her eye towards the spot where Steerforth was walking,"
766 "with his mother leaning on his arm, showed me whom she meant; but beyond"

766 ""

766 "As she still stood looking fixedly at me, a twitching or throbbing,"
766 "from which I could not dissociate the idea of pain, came into that cruel"
766 "mark; and lifted up the corner of her lip as if with scorn, or with a"
766 "pity that despised its object. She put her hand upon it hurriedly--a"
766 "hand so thin and delicate, that when I had seen her hold it up before"
766 "the fire to shade her face, I had compared it in my thoughts to fine"

766 "account of their mutual affection, but because of the strong personal"
766 "resemblance between them, and the manner in which what was haughty or"
766 "impetuous in him was softened by age and sex, in her, to a gracious"
766 "dignity. I thought, more than once, that it was well no serious cause of"
766 "division had ever come between them; or two such natures--I ought rather"
766 "to express it, two such shades of the same nature--might have been"
766 "harder to reconcile than the two extremest opposites in creation. The"

766 ""
766 "One other little circumstance connected with Miss Dartle I must"
766 "not omit; for I had reason to remember it thereafter, when all the"
766 "irremediable past was rendered plain. During the whole of this day, but"
766 "especially from this period of it, Steerforth exerted himself with his"
766 "utmost skill, and that was with his utmost ease, to charm this singular"
766 "creature into a pleasant and pleased companion. That he should succeed,"
766 "was no matter of surprise to me. That she should struggle against the"
766 "fascinating influence of his delightful art--delightful nature I thought"
766 "it then--did not surprise me either; for I knew that she was sometimes"
766 "jaundiced and perverse. I saw her features and her manner slowly change;"
766 "I saw her look at him with growing admiration; I saw her try, more and"
766 "more faintly, but always angrily, as if she condemned a weakness in"
766 "herself, to resist the captivating power that he possessed; and finally,"
766 "I saw her sharp glance soften, and her smile become quite gentle, and I"
766 "ceased to be afraid of her as I had really been all day, and we all sat"
766 "about the fire, talking and laughing together, with as little reserve as"
766 "if we had been children."
766 ""
766 "Whether it was because we had sat there so long, or because Steerforth"
766 "was resolved not to lose the advantage he had gained, I do not know; but"
766 "we did not remain in the dining-room more than five minutes after her"
766 "departure. 'She is playing her harp,' said Steerforth, softly, at the"
766 "drawing-room door, 'and nobody but my mother has heard her do that, I"
766 "believe, these three years.' He said it with a curious smile, which was"
766 "gone directly; and we went into the room and found her alone."
766 ""
766 "'Don't get up,' said Steerforth (which she had already done)' my dear"
766 "Rosa, don't! Be kind for once, and sing us an Irish song.'"
766 ""
766 "'What do you care for an Irish song?' she returned."
766 ""
766 "'Much!' said Steerforth. 'Much more than for any other. Here is Daisy,"
766 "too, loves music from his soul. Sing us an Irish song, Rosa! and let me"
766 "sit and listen as I used to do.'"
766 ""
766 "He did not touch her, or the chair from which she had risen, but sat"
766 "himself near the harp. She stood beside it for some little while, in a"
766 "curious way, going through the motion of playing it with her right hand,"
766 "but not sounding it. At length she sat down, and drew it to her with one"
766 "sudden action, and played and sang."
766 ""
766 "I don't know what it was, in her touch or voice, that made that song the"
766 "most unearthly I have ever heard in my life, or can imagine. There was"
766 "something fearful in the reality of it. It was as if it had never been"
766 "written, or set to music, but sprung out of passion within her; which"
766 "found imperfect utterance in the low sounds of her voice, and crouched"
766 "again when all was still. I was dumb when she leaned beside the harp"
766 "again, playing it, but not sounding it, with her right hand."
766 ""
766 "A minute more, and this had roused me from my trance:--Steerforth had"
766 "left his seat, and gone to her, and had put his arm laughingly about"
766 "her, and had said, 'Come, Rosa, for the future we will love each other"
766 "very much!' And she had struck him, and had thrown him off with the fury"
766 "of a wild cat, and had burst out of the room."

766 "incomprehensibility."
766 ""
766 "I expressed as much of my astonishment as was then capable of"

766 "'Oh, Heaven knows,' said Steerforth. 'Anything you like--or nothing!"
766 "I told you she took everything, herself included, to a grindstone, and"

766 "Mr. Omer's face and manner went for so much, that I could"
766 "conscientiously nod my head, as divining his meaning. My quickness of"

766 "is principally on account of her being in an unsettled state, you"
766 "see. We have talked it over a good deal, her uncle and myself, and her"
766 "sweetheart and myself, after business; and I consider it is principally"
766 "on account of her being unsettled. You must always recollect of Em'ly,'"
766 "said Mr. Omer, shaking his head gently, 'that she's a most extraordinary"
766 "affectionate little thing. The proverb says, \"You can't make a silk"
766 "purse out of a sow's ear.\" Well, I don't know about that. I rather think"
766 "you may, if you begin early in life. She has made a home out of that old"

766 "that gives me a high opinion of him), and went and took as comfortable"
766 "a little house as you or I could wish to clap eyes on. That little"
766 "house is now furnished right through, as neat and complete as a doll's"
766 "parlour; and but for Barkis's illness having taken this bad turn, poor"

766 "all that, is, as one may say, close to her and far away from her, both"
766 "at once. Barkis's death needn't put it off much, but his lingering"

766 "'Ah!' he rejoined, shaking his head, and looking very much dejected."
766 "'No good. A sad story, sir, however you come to know it. I never thought"
766 "there was harm in the girl. I wouldn't wish to mention it before my"
766 "daughter Minnie--for she'd take me up directly--but I never did. None of"
766 "us ever did.'"

766 "her uncle, even to the avoidance of her chosen husband. I shut the"
766 "door after him, that it might cause no disturbance of the quiet that"

766 "whether it was a confusion of the shadows in the room, I don't know now."
766 ""
766 "I had leisure to think, before the kitchen fire, of pretty little"
766 "Emily's dread of death--which, added to what Mr. Omer had told me, I"

766 "blessed and thanked me over and over again for being such a comfort to"
766 "her (that was what she said) in her distress. She then entreated me to"
766 "come upstairs, sobbing that Mr. Barkis had always liked me and admired"
766 "me; that he had often talked of me, before he fell into a stupor; and"
766 "that she believed, in case of his coming to himself again, he would"
766 "brighten up at sight of me, if he could brighten up at any earthly"

766 "The probability of his ever doing so, appeared to me, when I saw him, to"
766 "be very small. He was lying with his head and shoulders out of bed, in"
766 "an uncomfortable attitude, half resting on the box which had cost him so"
766 "much pain and trouble. I learned, that, when he was past creeping out of"
766 "bed to open it, and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the"
766 "divining rod I had seen him use, he had required to have it placed on"
766 "the chair at the bed-side, where he had ever since embraced it, night"
766 "and day. His arm lay on it now. Time and the world were slipping from"
766 "beneath him, but the box was there; and the last words he had uttered"
766 "were (in an explanatory tone) 'Old clothes!'"
766 ""
766 "'Barkis, my dear!' said Peggotty, almost cheerfully: bending over him,"
766 "while her brother and I stood at the bed's foot. 'Here's my dear boy--my"

766 "messages by, you know! Won't you speak to Master Davy?'"

766 "It was not difficult for me, on Peggotty's solicitation, to resolve to"
766 "stay where I was, until after the remains of the poor carrier should"
766 "have made their last journey to Blunderstone. She had long ago bought,"
766 "out of her own savings, a little piece of ground in our old churchyard"

766 "satisfaction, of a personal and professional nature, in taking charge of"
766 "Mr. Barkis's will, and expounding its contents."
766 ""
766 "I may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will"
766 "should be looked for in the box. After some search, it was found in the"
766 "box, at the bottom of a horse's nose-bag; wherein (besides hay) there"
766 "was discovered an old gold watch, with chain and seals, which Mr. Barkis"
766 "had worn on his wedding-day, and which had never been seen before or"
766 "since; a silver tobacco-stopper, in the form of a leg; an imitation"
766 "lemon, full of minute cups and saucers, which I have some idea Mr."
766 "Barkis must have purchased to present to me when I was a child, and"
766 "afterwards found himself unable to part with; eighty-seven guineas and"
766 "a half, in guineas and half-guineas; two hundred and ten pounds, in"
766 "perfectly clean Bank notes; certain receipts for Bank of England"
766 "stock; an old horseshoe, a bad shilling, a piece of camphor, and an"
766 "oyster-shell. From the circumstance of the latter article having"
766 "been much polished, and displaying prismatic colours on the inside,"
766 "I conclude that Mr. Barkis had some general ideas about pearls, which"
766 "never resolved themselves into anything definite."

766 "For years and years, Mr. Barkis had carried this box, on all his"
766 "journeys, every day. That it might the better escape notice, he had"

766 "sorts of unnecessary errands. As to deploring her misfortunes, she"
766 "appeared to have entirely lost the recollection of ever having had any."
766 "She preserved an equable cheerfulness in the midst of her sympathy,"
766 "which was not the least astonishing part of the change that had come"
766 "over her. Querulousness was out of the question. I did not even observe"
766 "her voice to falter, or a tear to escape from her eyes, the whole day"

766 "together, and he having fallen asleep in perfect exhaustion, she broke"
766 "into a half-suppressed fit of sobbing and crying, and taking me to the"
766 "door, said, 'Ever bless you, Mas'r Davy, be a friend to him, poor dear!'"
766 "Then, she immediately ran out of the house to wash her face, in order"
766 "that she might sit quietly beside him, and be found at work there, when"

766 "on this occasion, I recollect well, by a miscellaneous taste of tea,"
766 "coffee, butter, bacon, cheese, new loaves, firewood, candles, and walnut"

766 "inquired in what respect? I replied, with all due deference to his"
766 "experience (but with more deference, I am afraid, to his being Dora's"
766 "father), that perhaps it was a little nonsensical that the Registry of"
766 "that Court, containing the original wills of all persons leaving effects"
766 "within the immense province of Canterbury, for three whole centuries,"
766 "should be an accidental building, never designed for the purpose, leased"
766 "by the registrars for their Own private emolument, unsafe, not even"
766 "ascertained to be fire-proof, choked with the important documents"
766 "it held, and positively, from the roof to the basement, a mercenary"
766 "speculation of the registrars, who took great fees from the public, and"
766 "crammed the public's wills away anyhow and anywhere, having no other"
766 "object than to get rid of them cheaply. That, perhaps, it was a little"
766 "unreasonable that these registrars in the receipt of profits amounting"
766 "to eight or nine thousand pounds a year (to say nothing of the profits"
766 "of the deputy registrars, and clerks of seats), should not be obliged to"
766 "spend a little of that money, in finding a reasonably safe place for the"
766 "important documents which all classes of people were compelled to hand"
766 "over to them, whether they would or no. That, perhaps, it was a little"
766 "unjust, that all the great offices in this great office should be"
766 "magnificent sinecures, while the unfortunate working-clerks in the cold"
766 "dark room upstairs were the worst rewarded, and the least considered"
766 "men, doing important services, in London. That perhaps it was a little"
766 "indecent that the principal registrar of all, whose duty it was to"
766 "find the public, constantly resorting to this place, all needful"
766 "accommodation, should be an enormous sinecurist in virtue of that post"
766 "(and might be, besides, a clergyman, a pluralist, the holder of a"
766 "staff in a cathedral, and what not),--while the public was put to the"
766 "inconvenience of which we had a specimen every afternoon when the office"
766 "was busy, and which we knew to be quite monstrous. That, perhaps,"
766 "in short, this Prerogative Office of the diocese of Canterbury was"
766 "altogether such a pestilent job, and such a pernicious absurdity, that"
766 "but for its being squeezed away in a corner of St. Paul's Churchyard,"
766 "which few people knew, it must have been turned completely inside out,"
766 "and upside down, long ago."

766 "Mr. Spenlow smiled as I became modestly warm on the subject, and then"
766 "argued this question with me as he had argued the other. He said, what"

766 "that their wills were in safe keeping, and took it for granted that the"
766 "office was not to be made better, who was the worse for it? Nobody. Who"
766 "was the better for it? All the Sinecurists. Very well. Then the good"
766 "predominated. It might not be a perfect system; nothing was perfect;"
766 "but what he objected to, was, the insertion of the wedge. Under the"
766 "Prerogative Office, the country had been glorious. Insert the wedge into"
766 "the Prerogative Office, and the country would cease to be glorious. He"
766 "considered it the principle of a gentleman to take things as he found"
766 "them; and he had no doubt the Prerogative Office would last our time. I"
766 "deferred to his opinion, though I had great doubts of it myself. I find"
766 "he was right, however; for it has not only lasted to the present moment,"
766 "but has done so in the teeth of a great parliamentary report made (not"
766 "too willingly) eighteen years ago, when all these objections of mine"
766 "were set forth in detail, and when the existing stowage for wills was"
766 "described as equal to the accumulation of only two years and a half"
766 "more. What they have done with them since; whether they have lost many,"

766 "Of Steerforth I said nothing. I only told her there had been sad grief"
766 "at Yarmouth, on account of Emily's flight; and that on me it made a"
766 "double wound, by reason of the circumstances attending it. I knew how"
766 "quick she always was to divine the truth, and that she would never be"
766 "the first to breathe his name."
766 ""
766 "To this letter, I received an answer by return of post. As I read it, I"

766 "While I had been away from home lately, Traddles had called twice or"
766 "thrice. Finding Peggotty within, and being informed by Peggotty (who"
766 "always volunteered that information to whomsoever would receive"
766 "it), that she was my old nurse, he had established a good-humoured"
766 "acquaintance with her, and had stayed to have a little chat with her"
766 "about me. So Peggotty said; but I am afraid the chat was all on her"
766 "own side, and of immoderate length, as she was very difficult indeed to"
766 "stop, God bless her! when she had me for her theme."

766 "This reminds me, not only that I expected Traddles on a certain"
766 "afternoon of his own appointing, which was now come, but that Mrs. Crupp"
766 "had resigned everything appertaining to her office (the salary excepted)"

766 "holding divers conversations respecting Peggotty, in a very high-pitched"
766 "voice, on the staircase--with some invisible Familiar it would appear,"
766 "for corporeally speaking she was quite alone at those times--addressed a"
766 "letter to me, developing her views. Beginning it with that statement"
766 "of universal application, which fitted every occurrence of her life,"
766 "namely, that she was a mother herself, she went on to inform me that"
766 "she had once seen very different days, but that at all periods of her"
766 "existence she had had a constitutional objection to spies, intruders,"
766 "and informers. She named no names, she said; let them the cap fitted,"
766 "wear it; but spies, intruders, and informers, especially in widders'"
766 "weeds (this clause was underlined), she had ever accustomed herself to"
766 "look down upon. If a gentleman was the victim of spies, intruders, and"
766 "informers (but still naming no names), that was his own pleasure. He"
766 "had a right to please himself; so let him do. All that she, Mrs. Crupp,"
766 "stipulated for, was, that she should not be 'brought in contract'"
766 "with such persons. Therefore she begged to be excused from any further"
766 "attendance on the top set, until things were as they formerly was, and"
766 "as they could be wished to be; and further mentioned that her little"
766 "book would be found upon the breakfast-table every Saturday morning,"

766 "After this, Mrs. Crupp confined herself to making pitfalls on the"

766 "an execution put into our house, for rent. Mrs. Micawber was in such"

766 "'My dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, 'I have already done so, because"

766 "offering a price, and was hailed by the relenting broker, and went back"

766 "As soon as I could recover my presence of mind, which quite deserted me"
766 "in the first overpowering shock of my aunt's intelligence, I proposed"
766 "to Mr. Dick to come round to the chandler's shop, and take possession of"
766 "the bed which Mr. Peggotty had lately vacated. The chandler's shop being"
766 "in Hungerford Market, and Hungerford Market being a very different place"
766 "in those days, there was a low wooden colonnade before the door (not"
766 "very unlike that before the house where the little man and woman used"
766 "to live, in the old weather-glass), which pleased Mr. Dick mightily. The"
766 "glory of lodging over this structure would have compensated him, I dare"
766 "say, for many inconveniences; but, as there were really few to bear,"
766 "beyond the compound of flavours I have already mentioned, and perhaps"
766 "the want of a little more elbow-room, he was perfectly charmed with his"
766 "accommodation. Mrs. Crupp had indignantly assured him that there wasn't"
766 "room to swing a cat there; but, as Mr. Dick justly observed to me,"
766 "sitting down on the foot of the bed, nursing his leg, 'You know,"
766 "Trotwood, I don't want to swing a cat. I never do swing a cat."
766 "Therefore, what does that signify to ME!'"
766 ""
766 "I tried to ascertain whether Mr. Dick had any understanding of the"
766 "causes of this sudden and great change in my aunt's affairs. As I might"
766 "have expected, he had none at all. The only account he could give of it"
766 "was, that my aunt had said to him, the day before yesterday, 'Now, Dick,"
766 "are you really and truly the philosopher I take you for?' That then"
766 "he had said, Yes, he hoped so. That then my aunt had said, 'Dick, I"
766 "am ruined.' That then he had said, 'Oh, indeed!' That then my aunt had"
766 "praised him highly, which he was glad of. And that then they had come to"
766 "me, and had had bottled porter and sandwiches on the road."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Dick was so very complacent, sitting on the foot of the bed, nursing"
766 "his leg, and telling me this, with his eyes wide open and a surprised"
766 "smile, that I am sorry to say I was provoked into explaining to him"
766 "that ruin meant distress, want, and starvation; but I was soon bitterly"
766 "reproved for this harshness, by seeing his face turn pale, and tears"
766 "course down his lengthened cheeks, while he fixed upon me a look of such"
766 "unutterable woe, that it might have softened a far harder heart than"
766 "mine. I took infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than I had"
766 "taken to depress him; and I soon understood (as I ought to have known at"
766 "first) that he had been so confident, merely because of his faith in"
766 "the wisest and most wonderful of women, and his unbounded reliance on my"
766 "intellectual resources. The latter, I believe, he considered a match for"
766 "any kind of disaster not absolutely mortal."
766 ""
766 "'What can we do, Trotwood?' said Mr. Dick. 'There's the Memorial-'"
766 ""
766 "'To be sure there is,' said I. 'But all we can do just now, Mr. Dick,"
766 "is to keep a cheerful countenance, and not let my aunt see that we are"
766 "thinking about it.'"
766 ""
766 "He assented to this in the most earnest manner; and implored me, if I"
766 "should see him wandering an inch out of the right course, to recall him"
766 "by some of those superior methods which were always at my command. But I"
766 "regret to state that the fright I had given him proved too much for his"
766 "best attempts at concealment. All the evening his eyes wandered to my"
766 "aunt's face, with an expression of the most dismal apprehension, as if"
766 "he saw her growing thin on the spot. He was conscious of this, and put"
766 "a constraint upon his head; but his keeping that immovable, and sitting"
766 "rolling his eyes like a piece of machinery, did not mend the matter at"
766 "all. I saw him look at the loaf at supper (which happened to be a small"
766 "one), as if nothing else stood between us and famine; and when my aunt"
766 "insisted on his making his customary repast, I detected him in the act"
766 "of pocketing fragments of his bread and cheese; I have no doubt for the"
766 "purpose of reviving us with those savings, when we should have reached"
766 "an advanced stage of attenuation."
766 ""
766 "My aunt, on the other hand, was in a composed frame of mind, which was"
766 "a lesson to all of us--to me, I am sure. She was extremely gracious"
766 "to Peggotty, except when I inadvertently called her by that name; and,"
766 "strange as I knew she felt in London, appeared quite at home. She was"
766 "to have my bed, and I was to lie in the sitting-room, to keep guard over"
766 "her. She made a great point of being so near the river, in case of a"
766 "conflagration; and I suppose really did find some satisfaction in that"
766 "circumstance."

766 "was, to try if my articles could be cancelled and the premium recovered."
766 "I got some breakfast on the Heath, and walked back to Doctors' Commons,"
766 "along the watered roads and through a pleasant smell of summer flowers,"
766 "growing in gardens and carried into town on hucksters' heads, intent on"
766 "this first effort to meet our altered circumstances."
766 ""
766 "I arrived at the office so soon, after all, that I had half an hour's"
766 "loitering about the Commons, before old Tiffey, who was always first,"
766 "appeared with his key. Then I sat down in my shady corner, looking up"
766 "at the sunlight on the opposite chimney-pots, and thinking about Dora;"
766 "until Mr. Spenlow came in, crisp and curly."
766 ""
766 "'How are you, Copperfield?' said he. 'Fine morning!'"
766 ""
766 "'Beautiful morning, sir,' said I. 'Could I say a word to you before you"
766 "go into Court?'"
766 ""
766 "'By all means,' said he. 'Come into my room.'"
766 ""
766 "I followed him into his room, and he began putting on his gown, and"
766 "touching himself up before a little glass he had, hanging inside a"
766 "closet door."
766 ""
766 "'I am sorry to say,' said I, 'that I have some rather disheartening"
766 "intelligence from my aunt.'"
766 ""
766 "'No!' said he. 'Dear me! Not paralysis, I hope?'"
766 ""
766 "'It has no reference to her health, sir,' I replied. 'She has met with"
766 "some large losses. In fact, she has very little left, indeed.'"
766 ""
766 "'You as-tound me, Copperfield!' cried Mr. Spenlow."
766 ""
766 "I shook my head. 'Indeed, sir,' said I, 'her affairs are so changed,"
766 "that I wished to ask you whether it would be possible--at a sacrifice on"
766 "our part of some portion of the premium, of course,' I put in this, on"
766 "the spur of the moment, warned by the blank expression of his face--'to"
766 "cancel my articles?'"
766 ""
766 "What it cost me to make this proposal, nobody knows. It was like asking,"
766 "as a favour, to be sentenced to transportation from Dora."
766 ""
766 "'To cancel your articles, Copperfield? Cancel?'"
766 ""
766 "I explained with tolerable firmness, that I really did not know where"
766 "my means of subsistence were to come from, unless I could earn them for"
766 "myself. I had no fear for the future, I said--and I laid great emphasis"
766 "on that, as if to imply that I should still be decidedly eligible for a"
766 "son-in-law one of these days--but, for the present, I was thrown upon"
766 "my own resources. 'I am extremely sorry to hear this, Copperfield,' said"
766 "Mr. Spenlow. 'Extremely sorry. It is not usual to cancel articles for"
766 "any such reason. It is not a professional course of proceeding. It is"
766 "not a convenient precedent at all. Far from it. At the same time--'"
766 ""
766 "'You are very good, sir,' I murmured, anticipating a concession."
766 ""
766 "'Not at all. Don't mention it,' said Mr. Spenlow. 'At the same time, I"
766 "was going to say, if it had been my lot to have my hands unfettered--if"
766 "I had not a partner--Mr. Jorkins--'"
766 ""
766 "My hopes were dashed in a moment, but I made another effort."
766 ""
766 "'Do you think, sir,' said I, 'if I were to mention it to Mr. Jorkins--'"
766 ""
766 "Mr. Spenlow shook his head discouragingly. 'Heaven forbid, Copperfield,'"
766 "he replied, 'that I should do any man an injustice: still less, Mr."
766 "Jorkins. But I know my partner, Copperfield. Mr. Jorkins is not a man"
766 "to respond to a proposition of this peculiar nature. Mr. Jorkins is very"
766 "difficult to move from the beaten track. You know what he is!'"
766 ""
766 "I am sure I knew nothing about him, except that he had originally been"
766 "alone in the business, and now lived by himself in a house near Montagu"
766 "Square, which was fearfully in want of painting; that he came very"
766 "late of a day, and went away very early; that he never appeared to be"
766 "consulted about anything; and that he had a dingy little black-hole of"
766 "his own upstairs, where no business was ever done, and where there was"
766 "a yellow old cartridge-paper pad upon his desk, unsoiled by ink, and"
766 "reported to be twenty years of age."
766 ""
766 "'Would you object to my mentioning it to him, sir?' I asked."
766 ""
766 "'By no means,' said Mr. Spenlow. 'But I have some experience of Mr."
766 "Jorkins, Copperfield. I wish it were otherwise, for I should be happy"
766 "to meet your views in any respect. I cannot have the objection to your"
766 "mentioning it to Mr. Jorkins, Copperfield, if you think it worth while.'"
766 ""
766 "Availing myself of this permission, which was given with a warm shake"
766 "of the hand, I sat thinking about Dora, and looking at the sunlight"
766 "stealing from the chimney-pots down the wall of the opposite house,"
766 "until Mr. Jorkins came. I then went up to Mr. Jorkins's room, and"
766 "evidently astonished Mr. Jorkins very much by making my appearance"
766 "there."
766 ""
766 "'Come in, Mr. Copperfield,' said Mr. Jorkins. 'Come in!'"
766 ""
766 "I went in, and sat down; and stated my case to Mr. Jorkins pretty much"
766 "as I had stated it to Mr. Spenlow. Mr. Jorkins was not by any means the"
766 "awful creature one might have expected, but a large, mild, smooth-faced"
766 "man of sixty, who took so much snuff that there was a tradition in the"
766 "Commons that he lived principally on that stimulant, having little room"
766 "in his system for any other article of diet."
766 ""
766 "'You have mentioned this to Mr. Spenlow, I suppose?' said Mr. Jorkins;"
766 "when he had heard me, very restlessly, to an end."
766 ""
766 "I answered Yes, and told him that Mr. Spenlow had introduced his name."
766 ""
766 "'He said I should object?' asked Mr. Jorkins."
766 ""
766 "I was obliged to admit that Mr. Spenlow had considered it probable."
766 ""
766 "'I am sorry to say, Mr. Copperfield, I can't advance your object,' said"
766 "Mr. Jorkins, nervously. 'The fact is--but I have an appointment at the"
766 "Bank, if you'll have the goodness to excuse me.'"
766 ""
766 "With that he rose in a great hurry, and was going out of the room, when"
766 "I made bold to say that I feared, then, there was no way of arranging"
766 "the matter?"
766 ""
766 "'No!' said Mr. Jorkins, stopping at the door to shake his head. 'Oh, no!"
766 "I object, you know,' which he said very rapidly, and went out. 'You must"
766 "be aware, Mr. Copperfield,' he added, looking restlessly in at the door"
766 "again, 'if Mr. Spenlow objects--'"
766 ""
766 "'Personally, he does not object, sir,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Oh! Personally!' repeated Mr. Jorkins, in an impatient manner. 'I"
766 "assure you there's an objection, Mr. Copperfield. Hopeless! What you"
766 "wish to be done, can't be done. I--I really have got an appointment"
766 "at the Bank.' With that he fairly ran away; and to the best of my"
766 "knowledge, it was three days before he showed himself in the Commons"
766 "again."
766 ""
766 "Being very anxious to leave no stone unturned, I waited until Mr."
766 "Spenlow came in, and then described what had passed; giving him to"
766 "understand that I was not hopeless of his being able to soften the"
766 "adamantine Jorkins, if he would undertake the task."
766 ""
766 "'Copperfield,' returned Mr. Spenlow, with a gracious smile, 'you have"
766 "not known my partner, Mr. Jorkins, as long as I have. Nothing is"
766 "farther from my thoughts than to attribute any degree of artifice to Mr."
766 "Jorkins. But Mr. Jorkins has a way of stating his objections which often"
766 "deceives people. No, Copperfield!' shaking his head. 'Mr. Jorkins is not"
766 "to be moved, believe me!'"
766 ""
766 "I was completely bewildered between Mr. Spenlow and Mr. Jorkins, as"
766 "to which of them really was the objecting partner; but I saw with"
766 "sufficient clearness that there was obduracy somewhere in the firm, and"
766 "that the recovery of my aunt's thousand pounds was out of the"
766 "question. In a state of despondency, which I remember with anything"
766 "but satisfaction, for I know it still had too much reference to myself"
766 "(though always in connexion with Dora), I left the office, and went"
766 "homeward."
766 ""
766 "I was trying to familiarize my mind with the worst, and to present to"
766 "myself the arrangements we should have to make for the future in their"
766 "sternest aspect, when a hackney-chariot coming after me, and stopping at"
766 "my very feet, occasioned me to look up. A fair hand was stretched forth"
766 "to me from the window; and the face I had never seen without a feeling"
766 "of serenity and happiness, from the moment when it first turned back"
766 "on the old oak staircase with the great broad balustrade, and when I"
766 "associated its softened beauty with the stained-glass window in the"
766 "church, was smiling on me."
766 ""
766 "'Agnes!' I joyfully exclaimed. 'Oh, my dear Agnes, of all people in the"
766 "world, what a pleasure to see you!'"
766 ""
766 "'Is it, indeed?' she said, in her cordial voice."
766 ""
766 "'I want to talk to you so much!' said I. 'It's such a lightening of my"
766 "heart, only to look at you! If I had had a conjuror's cap, there is no"
766 "one I should have wished for but you!'"
766 ""
766 "'What?' returned Agnes."
766 ""
766 "'Well! perhaps Dora first,' I admitted, with a blush."
766 ""
766 "'Certainly, Dora first, I hope,' said Agnes, laughing."
766 ""
766 "'But you next!' said I. 'Where are you going?'"
766 ""
766 "She was going to my rooms to see my aunt. The day being very fine, she"
766 "was glad to come out of the chariot, which smelt (I had my head in it"
766 "all this time) like a stable put under a cucumber-frame. I dismissed the"
766 "coachman, and she took my arm, and we walked on together. She was like"
766 "Hope embodied, to me. How different I felt in one short minute, having"
766 "Agnes at my side!"
766 ""
766 "My aunt had written her one of the odd, abrupt notes--very little longer"
766 "than a Bank note--to which her epistolary efforts were usually limited."
766 "She had stated therein that she had fallen into adversity, and was"
766 "leaving Dover for good, but had quite made up her mind to it, and was"
766 "so well that nobody need be uncomfortable about her. Agnes had come to"
766 "London to see my aunt, between whom and herself there had been a mutual"
766 "liking these many years: indeed, it dated from the time of my taking up"
766 "my residence in Mr. Wickfield's house. She was not alone, she said. Her"
766 "papa was with her--and Uriah Heep."
766 ""
766 "'And now they are partners,' said I. 'Confound him!'"
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' said Agnes. 'They have some business here; and I took advantage"
766 "of their coming, to come too. You must not think my visit all friendly"
766 "and disinterested, Trotwood, for--I am afraid I may be cruelly"
766 "prejudiced--I do not like to let papa go away alone, with him.' 'Does he"
766 "exercise the same influence over Mr. Wickfield still, Agnes?'"
766 ""
766 "Agnes shook her head. 'There is such a change at home,' said she, 'that"
766 "you would scarcely know the dear old house. They live with us now.'"
766 ""
766 "'They?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Heep and his mother. He sleeps in your old room,' said Agnes,"
766 "looking up into my face."
766 ""
766 "'I wish I had the ordering of his dreams,' said I. 'He wouldn't sleep"
766 "there long.'"
766 ""
766 "'I keep my own little room,' said Agnes, 'where I used to learn my"
766 "lessons. How the time goes! You remember? The little panelled room that"
766 "opens from the drawing-room?'"
766 ""
766 "'Remember, Agnes? When I saw you, for the first time, coming out at the"
766 "door, with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side?'"
766 ""
766 "'It is just the same,' said Agnes, smiling. 'I am glad you think of it"
766 "so pleasantly. We were very happy.'"
766 ""
766 "'We were, indeed,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'I keep that room to myself still; but I cannot always desert Mrs. Heep,"
766 "you know. And so,' said Agnes, quietly, 'I feel obliged to bear her"
766 "company, when I might prefer to be alone. But I have no other reason to"
766 "complain of her. If she tires me, sometimes, by her praises of her son,"
766 "it is only natural in a mother. He is a very good son to her.'"
766 ""
766 "I looked at Agnes when she said these words, without detecting in her"
766 "any consciousness of Uriah's design. Her mild but earnest eyes met"
766 "mine with their own beautiful frankness, and there was no change in her"
766 "gentle face."
766 ""
766 "'The chief evil of their presence in the house,' said Agnes, 'is that I"
766 "cannot be as near papa as I could wish--Uriah Heep being so much between"
766 "us--and cannot watch over him, if that is not too bold a thing to say,"
766 "as closely as I would. But if any fraud or treachery is practising"
766 "against him, I hope that simple love and truth will be strong in the"
766 "end. I hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any"
766 "evil or misfortune in the world.'"
766 ""
766 "A certain bright smile, which I never saw on any other face, died away,"
766 "even while I thought how good it was, and how familiar it had once been"
766 "to me; and she asked me, with a quick change of expression (we were"
766 "drawing very near my street), if I knew how the reverse in my aunt's"
766 "circumstances had been brought about. On my replying no, she had not"
766 "told me yet, Agnes became thoughtful, and I fancied I felt her arm"
766 "tremble in mine."
766 ""
766 "We found my aunt alone, in a state of some excitement. A difference"
766 "of opinion had arisen between herself and Mrs. Crupp, on an abstract"
766 "question (the propriety of chambers being inhabited by the gentler sex);"
766 "and my aunt, utterly indifferent to spasms on the part of Mrs. Crupp,"
766 "had cut the dispute short, by informing that lady that she smelt of"
766 "my brandy, and that she would trouble her to walk out. Both of these"
766 "expressions Mrs. Crupp considered actionable, and had expressed her"
766 "intention of bringing before a 'British Judy'--meaning, it was supposed,"
766 "the bulwark of our national liberties."

766 "My aunt, however, having had time to cool, while Peggotty was out"
766 "showing Mr. Dick the soldiers at the Horse Guards--and being, besides,"
766 "greatly pleased to see Agnes--rather plumed herself on the affair than"
766 "otherwise, and received us with unimpaired good humour. When Agnes laid"
766 "her bonnet on the table, and sat down beside her, I could not but think,"
766 "looking on her mild eyes and her radiant forehead, how natural it"
766 "seemed to have her there; how trustfully, although she was so young and"
766 "inexperienced, my aunt confided in her; how strong she was, indeed, in"
766 "simple love and truth."

766 "a generous boy--I suppose I must say, young man, now--and I am proud of"
766 "you, my dear. So far, so good. Now, Trot and Agnes, let us look the case"
766 "of Betsey Trotwood in the face, and see how it stands.'"
766 ""
766 "I observed Agnes turn pale, as she looked very attentively at my aunt."
766 "My aunt, patting her cat, looked very attentively at Agnes."

766 "'Betsey Trotwood,' said my aunt, who had always kept her money matters"
766 "to herself. '--I don't mean your sister, Trot, my dear, but myself--had"
766 "a certain property. It don't matter how much; enough to live on. More;"
766 "for she had saved a little, and added to it. Betsey funded her property"
766 "for some time, and then, by the advice of her man of business, laid"
766 "it out on landed security. That did very well, and returned very good"
766 "interest, till Betsey was paid off. I am talking of Betsey as if she"
766 "was a man-of-war. Well! Then, Betsey had to look about her, for a new"
766 "investment. She thought she was wiser, now, than her man of business,"
766 "who was not such a good man of business by this time, as he used to"
766 "be--I am alluding to your father, Agnes--and she took it into her head"
766 "to lay it out for herself. So she took her pigs,' said my aunt, 'to a"
766 "foreign market; and a very bad market it turned out to be. First, she"
766 "lost in the mining way, and then she lost in the diving way--fishing up"
766 "treasure, or some such Tom Tiddler nonsense,' explained my aunt, rubbing"
766 "her nose; 'and then she lost in the mining way again, and, last of all,"
766 "to set the thing entirely to rights, she lost in the banking way. I"
766 "don't know what the Bank shares were worth for a little while,' said my"
766 "aunt; 'cent per cent was the lowest of it, I believe; but the Bank was"
766 "at the other end of the world, and tumbled into space, for what I know;"
766 "anyhow, it fell to pieces, and never will and never can pay sixpence;"
766 "and Betsey's sixpences were all there, and there's an end of them. Least"
766 "said, soonest mended!'"
766 ""
766 "My aunt concluded this philosophical summary, by fixing her eyes with a"
766 "kind of triumph on Agnes, whose colour was gradually returning."

766 "'Dear Miss Trotwood, is that all the history?' said Agnes."
766 ""
766 "'I hope it's enough, child,' said my aunt. 'If there had been more"
766 "money to lose, it wouldn't have been all, I dare say. Betsey would have"
766 "contrived to throw that after the rest, and make another chapter, I have"
766 "little doubt. But there was no more money, and there's no more story.'"
766 ""
766 "Agnes had listened at first with suspended breath. Her colour still came"
766 "and went, but she breathed more freely. I thought I knew why. I thought"
766 "she had had some fear that her unhappy father might be in some way to"
766 "blame for what had happened. My aunt took her hand in hers, and laughed."
766 ""
766 "'Is that all?' repeated my aunt. 'Why, yes, that's all, except, \"And she"

766 "of these days. Now, Agnes, you have a wise head. So have you, Trot, in"
766 "some things, though I can't compliment you always'; and here my aunt"
766 "shook her own at me, with an energy peculiar to herself. 'What's to be"
766 "done? Here's the cottage, taking one time with another, will produce"
766 "say seventy pounds a year. I think we may safely put it down at"
766 "that. Well!--That's all we've got,' said my aunt; with whom it was an"
766 "idiosyncrasy, as it is with some horses, to stop very short when she"
766 "appeared to be in a fair way of going on for a long while."
766 ""
766 "'Then,' said my aunt, after a rest, 'there's Dick. He's good for a"
766 "hundred a-year, but of course that must be expended on himself. I would"
766 "sooner send him away, though I know I am the only person who appreciates"
766 "him, than have him, and not spend his money on himself. How can Trot and"

766 "rid of, for six months at least, unless they could be underlet, and that"
766 "I don't believe. The last man died here. Five people out of six would"
766 "die--of course--of that woman in nankeen with the flannel petticoat. I"
766 "have a little ready money; and I agree with you, the best thing we can"
766 "do, is, to live the term out here, and get a bedroom hard by.'"
766 ""
766 "I thought it my duty to hint at the discomfort my aunt would sustain,"
766 "from living in a continual state of guerilla warfare with Mrs. Crupp;"
766 "but she disposed of that objection summarily by declaring that, on the"

766 "hours and hours I had devoted to fagging about town, and to and fro upon"
766 "the Norwood Road, 'I have abundance of time.'"

766 "used to occupy himself in his study, early in the morning, and in the"
766 "evening--and that probably my leisure would suit his requirements very"
766 "well. I was scarcely more delighted with the prospect of earning my own"

766 "acting on the advice of Agnes, I sat down and wrote a letter to the"

766 "shabby coat, and had no yearnings after gallant greys. My whole manner"
766 "of thinking of our late misfortune was changed. What I had to do, was,"
766 "to show my aunt that her past goodness to me had not been thrown away"
766 "on an insensible, ungrateful object. What I had to do, was, to turn the"
766 "painful discipline of my younger days to account, by going to work with"

766 "In this state, I went into a cottage that I saw was to let, and examined"

766 "in, and bark at the tradespeople through the railings, and a capital"
766 "room upstairs for my aunt. I came out again, hotter and faster than"

766 "hour too early; and, though I had not been, should have been obliged to"

766 "I came softly away from my place of observation, and avoiding that part"

766 "until it was ten o'clock. The church with the slender spire, that stands"
766 "on the top of the hill now, was not there then to tell me the time. An"
766 "old red-brick mansion, used as a school, was in its place; and a fine"

766 "When I approached the Doctor's cottage--a pretty old place, on which"
766 "he seemed to have expended some money, if I might judge from the"

766 "saw him walking in the garden at the side, gaiters and all, as if he"
766 "had never left off walking since the days of my pupilage. He had his old"
766 "companions about him, too; for there were plenty of high trees in the"
766 "neighbourhood, and two or three rooks were on the grass, looking after"

766 "it wonderfully; and that nothing could suit him better than the proposed"
766 "arrangements for morning and evening work, as it was his custom to walk"
766 "about in the daytime with his considering cap on. His papers were in"
766 "a little confusion, in consequence of Mr. Jack Maldon having lately"

766 "fashionable indeed. I have seen it displayed with such success, that I"
766 "have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have"
766 "been born caterpillars. Perhaps it impressed me the more then, because"
766 "it was new to me, but it certainly did not tend to exalt my opinion of,"

766 "'I came out to inquire whether Annie would like to go to the opera"
766 "tonight,' said Mr. Maldon, turning to her. 'It's the last good night"

766 "But he saw nothing. He told her, good-naturedly, that she was young and"
766 "ought to be amused and entertained, and must not allow herself to be"
766 "made dull by a dull old fellow. Moreover, he said, he wanted to hear her"
766 "sing all the new singer's songs to him; and how could she do that well,"
766 "unless she went? So the Doctor persisted in making the engagement for"
766 "her, and Mr. Jack Maldon was to come back to dinner. This concluded, he"

766 "her; and they had walked home by the fields, the Doctor told me, the"

766 "as we were employed. When I left, at nine o'clock, she was kneeling on"
766 "the ground at the Doctor's feet, putting on his shoes and gaiters for"
766 "him. There was a softened shade upon her face, thrown from some green"

766 "I deferred all I had to tell her until then; merely informing her in"
766 "my letters (all our communications were secretly forwarded through Miss"
766 "Mills), that I had much to tell her. In the meantime, I put myself on"

766 "newspapers to me, as one of his hopes, I had put the two things"
766 "together, and told Traddles in my letter that I wished to know how I"
766 "could qualify myself for this pursuit. Traddles now informed me, as the"
766 "result of his inquiries, that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary,"
766 "except in rare cases, for thorough excellence in it, that is to say,"
766 "a perfect and entire command of the mystery of short-hand writing and"
766 "reading, was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages;"
766 "and that it might perhaps be attained, by dint of perseverance, in the"
766 "course of a few years. Traddles reasonably supposed that this would"
766 "settle the business; but I, only feeling that here indeed were a few"

766 "neighbourhood to change this treasure into sixpences, or his bringing"

766 "I did not allow my resolution, with respect to the Parliamentary"
766 "Debates, to cool. It was one of the irons I began to heat immediately,"
766 "and one of the irons I kept hot, and hammered at, with a perseverance"
766 "I may honestly admire. I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and"
766 "mystery of stenography (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged"
766 "into a sea of perplexity that brought me, in a few weeks, to the"
766 "confines of distraction. The changes that were rung upon dots, which"
766 "in such a position meant such a thing, and in such another position"
766 "something else, entirely different; the wonderful vagaries that were"
766 "played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that resulted from"
766 "marks like flies' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve in a wrong"
766 "place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before me in"
766 "my sleep. When I had groped my way, blindly, through these difficulties,"
766 "and had mastered the alphabet, which was an Egyptian Temple in itself,"
766 "there then appeared a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary"
766 "characters; the most despotic characters I have ever known; who"
766 "insisted, for instance, that a thing like the beginning of a cobweb,"
766 "meant expectation, and that a pen-and-ink sky-rocket, stood for"
766 "disadvantageous. When I had fixed these wretches in my mind, I found"
766 "that they had driven everything else out of it; then, beginning again, I"
766 "forgot them; while I was picking them up, I dropped the other fragments"
766 "of the system; in short, it was almost heart-breaking."
766 ""
766 "It might have been quite heart-breaking, but for Dora, who was the stay"
766 "and anchor of my tempest-driven bark. Every scratch in the scheme was"
766 "a gnarled oak in the forest of difficulty, and I went on cutting them"
766 "down, one after another, with such vigour, that in three or four months"
766 "I was in a condition to make an experiment on one of our crack speakers"
766 "in the Commons. Shall I ever forget how the crack speaker walked off"
766 "from me before I began, and left my imbecile pencil staggering about the"
766 "paper as if it were in a fit!"
766 ""
766 "This would not do, it was quite clear. I was flying too high, and should"
766 "never get on, so. I resorted to Traddles for advice; who suggested"
766 "that he should dictate speeches to me, at a pace, and with occasional"
766 "stoppages, adapted to my weakness. Very grateful for this friendly aid,"
766 "I accepted the proposal; and night after night, almost every night, for"
766 "a long time, we had a sort of Private Parliament in Buckingham Street,"
766 "after I came home from the Doctor's."
766 ""
766 "I should like to see such a Parliament anywhere else! My aunt and Mr."

766 "volume of parliamentary orations, thundered astonishing invectives"
766 "against them. Standing by the table, with his finger in the page to keep"
766 "the place, and his right arm flourishing above his head, Traddles, as"
766 "Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Burke, Lord Castlereagh, Viscount"
766 "Sidmouth, or Mr. Canning, would work himself into the most violent"
766 "heats, and deliver the most withering denunciations of the profligacy"
766 "and corruption of my aunt and Mr. Dick; while I used to sit, at a little"
766 "distance, with my notebook on my knee, fagging after him with all my"
766 "might and main. The inconsistency and recklessness of Traddles were not"
766 "to be exceeded by any real politician. He was for any description of"
766 "policy, in the compass of a week; and nailed all sorts of colours to"
766 "every denomination of mast. My aunt, looking very like an immovable"
766 "Chancellor of the Exchequer, would occasionally throw in an interruption"
766 "or two, as 'Hear!' or 'No!' or 'Oh!' when the text seemed to require it:"
766 "which was always a signal to Mr. Dick (a perfect country gentleman)"
766 "to follow lustily with the same cry. But Mr. Dick got taxed with"
766 "such things in the course of his Parliamentary career, and was made"
766 "responsible for such awful consequences, that he became uncomfortable in"
766 "his mind sometimes. I believe he actually began to be afraid he really"
766 "had been doing something, tending to the annihilation of the British"
766 "constitution, and the ruin of the country."

766 "Often and often we pursued these debates until the clock pointed to"
766 "midnight, and the candles were burning down. The result of so much good"
766 "practice was, that by and by I began to keep pace with Traddles pretty"
766 "well, and should have been quite triumphant if I had had the least idea"
766 "what my notes were about. But, as to reading them after I had got them,"
766 "I might as well have copied the Chinese inscriptions of an immense"
766 "collection of tea-chests, or the golden characters on all the great red"

766 "There was nothing for it, but to turn back and begin all over again. It"
766 "was very hard, but I turned back, though with a heavy heart, and began"

766 "snail's pace; stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way, on"
766 "all sides, and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive"
766 "characters by sight wherever I met them. I was always punctual at"
766 "the office; at the Doctor's too: and I really did work, as the common"
766 "expression is, like a cart-horse. One day, when I went to the Commons as"
766 "usual, I found Mr. Spenlow in the doorway looking extremely grave, and"
766 "talking to himself. As he was in the habit of complaining of pains in"
766 "his head--he had naturally a short throat, and I do seriously believe"

766 "a door opening into the Commons, just within the little archway in St."
766 "Paul's Churchyard. I complied, in a very uncomfortable state, and with a"
766 "warm shooting all over me, as if my apprehensions were breaking out into"
766 "buds. When I allowed him to go on a little before, on account of the"
766 "narrowness of the way, I observed that he carried his head with a lofty"
766 "air that was particularly unpromising; and my mind misgave me that he"

766 "If I had not guessed this, on the way to the coffee-house, I could"

766 "a background of sideboard, on which were several inverted tumblers"

766 "endeavouring to take it from him, at the imminent risk of being bitten,"
766 "he kept it between his teeth so pertinaciously as to suffer himself"
766 "to be held suspended in the air by means of the document. At length I"
766 "obtained possession of it. After perusing it, I taxed Miss Spenlow with"

766 "himself. By little and little it came out, that, in the competition on"
766 "all points of appearance and gentility then running high in the Commons,"
766 "he had spent more than his professional income, which was not a very"

766 "shy gentleman in want of one, had nothing to do but submit himself"
766 "to the first inveigler, or be fought for, and become the prey of the"
766 "strongest. One of our clerks, who was an outsider, used, in the height"
766 "of this contest, to sit with his hat on, that he might be ready to rush"
766 "out and swear before a surrogate any victim who was brought in. The"
766 "system of inveigling continues, I believe, to this day. The last time I"
766 "was in the Commons, a civil able-bodied person in a white apron pounced"
766 "out upon me from a doorway, and whispering the word 'Marriage-licence'"
766 "in my ear, was with great difficulty prevented from taking me up in"
766 "his arms and lifting me into a proctor's. From this digression, let me"
766 "proceed to Dover."

766 "I found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage; and was"

766 "settled the little business I had to transact there, and slept there one"
766 "night, I walked on to Canterbury early in the morning. It was now"
766 "winter again; and the fresh, cold windy day, and the sweeping downland,"
766 "brightened up my hopes a little."
766 ""
766 "Coming into Canterbury, I loitered through the old streets with a sober"
766 "pleasure that calmed my spirits, and eased my heart. There were the old"
766 "signs, the old names over the shops, the old people serving in them. It"
766 "appeared so long, since I had been a schoolboy there, that I wondered"
766 "the place was so little changed, until I reflected how little I"
766 "was changed myself. Strange to say, that quiet influence which was"
766 "inseparable in my mind from Agnes, seemed to pervade even the city where"
766 "she dwelt. The venerable cathedral towers, and the old jackdaws and"
766 "rooks whose airy voices made them more retired than perfect silence"
766 "would have done; the battered gateways, one stuck full with statues,"
766 "long thrown down, and crumbled away, like the reverential pilgrims"
766 "who had gazed upon them; the still nooks, where the ivied growth of"
766 "centuries crept over gabled ends and ruined walls; the ancient houses,"
766 "the pastoral landscape of field, orchard, and garden; everywhere--on"
766 "everything--I felt the same serener air, the same calm, thoughtful,"
766 "softening spirit."

766 ""
766 "'My dear Copperfield,' he replied. 'To a man possessed of the higher"
766 "imaginative powers, the objection to legal studies is the amount of"
766 "detail which they involve. Even in our professional correspondence,'"
766 "said Mr. Micawber, glancing at some letters he was writing, 'the mind is"

766 "'It is humble,' said Mr. Micawber, '--to quote a favourite expression"

766 ""
766 "'My dear Copperfield, a man who labours under the pressure of pecuniary"
766 "embarrassments, is, with the generality of people, at a disadvantage."
766 "That disadvantage is not diminished, when that pressure necessitates the"
766 "drawing of stipendiary emoluments, before those emoluments are strictly"
766 "due and payable. All I can say is, that my friend Heep has responded"
766 "to appeals to which I need not more particularly refer, in a manner"
766 "calculated to redound equally to the honour of his head, and of his"
766 "heart.'"

766 "discussion of some topics, even with Mrs. Micawber herself (so long the"

766 "now devolving on me. I would therefore take the liberty of suggesting"
766 "that in our friendly intercourse--which I trust will never be"
766 "disturbed!--we draw a line. On one side of this line,' said Mr."

766 "the other, IS that exception; that is to say, the affairs of Messrs"

766 ""
766 "We have all some experience of a feeling, that comes over us"

766 "before, in a remote time--of our having been surrounded, dim ages ago,"
766 "by the same faces, objects, and circumstances--of our knowing perfectly"

766 "Wickfield's room, which was the shadow of its former self--having been"
766 "divested of a variety of conveniences, for the accommodation of the new"

766 "I had hoped to have no other companion than Agnes. But Mrs. Heep had"

766 "her rheumatics, as the wind then was, than the drawing-room or"
766 "dining-parlour. Though I could almost have consigned her to the mercies"
766 "of the wind on the topmost pinnacle of the Cathedral, without remorse, I"

766 ""
766 "His mother's eye was an evil eye to the rest of the world, I thought as"

766 "might have poured out its sands. She sat on one side of the fire; I sat"

766 "Agnes. Whensoever, slowly pondering over my letter, I lifted up my"
766 "eyes, and meeting the thoughtful face of Agnes, saw it clear, and beam"
766 "encouragement upon me, with its own angelic expression, I was conscious"
766 "presently of the evil eye passing me, and going on to her, and coming"
766 "back to me again, and dropping furtively upon the knitting. What the"
766 "knitting was, I don't know, not being learned in that art; but it looked"
766 "like a net; and as she worked away with those Chinese chopsticks of"
766 "knitting-needles, she showed in the firelight like an ill-looking"
766 "enchantress, baulked as yet by the radiant goodness opposite, but"
766 "getting ready for a cast of her net by and by."
766 ""
766 "At dinner she maintained her watch, with the same unwinking eyes. After"
766 "dinner, her son took his turn; and when Mr. Wickfield, himself, and I"
766 "were left alone together, leered at me, and writhed until I could hardly"
766 "bear it. In the drawing-room, there was the mother knitting and watching"
766 "again. All the time that Agnes sang and played, the mother sat at the"
766 "piano. Once she asked for a particular ballad, which she said her Ury"
766 "(who was yawning in a great chair) doted on; and at intervals she looked"
766 "round at him, and reported to Agnes that he was in raptures with the"
766 "music. But she hardly ever spoke--I question if she ever did--without"
766 "making some mention of him. It was evident to me that this was the duty"
766 "assigned to her."

766 "This lasted until bedtime. To have seen the mother and son, like two"
766 "great bats hanging over the whole house, and darkening it with their"

766 "downstairs, knitting and all, than gone to bed. I hardly got any sleep."
766 "Next day the knitting and watching began again, and lasted all day."

766 "remained within, to bear her company. Towards the twilight I went out"
766 "by myself, musing on what I ought to do, and whether I was justified"
766 "in withholding from Agnes, any longer, what Uriah Heep had told me in"
766 "London; for that began to trouble me again, very much."
766 ""
766 "I had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town, upon the"
766 "Ramsgate road, where there was a good path, when I was hailed, through"

766 "my art, the night I put you so much out of the way by sleeping before"
766 "your sitting-room fire, I never should have doubted you. As it is, I'm"
766 "sure I'll take off mother directly, and only too appy. I know you'll"
766 "excuse the precautions of affection, won't you? What a pity, Master"
766 "Copperfield, that you didn't condescend to return my confidence! I'm"
766 "sure I gave you every opportunity. But you never have condescended to"

766 "lead-coloured in the moonlight. 'Didn't I know it! But how little"
766 "you think of the rightful umbleness of a person in my station, Master"
766 "Copperfield! Father and me was both brought up at a foundation school"
766 "for boys; and mother, she was likewise brought up at a public, sort of"
766 "charitable, establishment. They taught us all a deal of umbleness--not"
766 "much else that I know of, from morning to night. We was to be umble to"
766 "this person, and umble to that; and to pull off our caps here, and"
766 "to make bows there; and always to know our place, and abase ourselves"
766 "before our betters. And we had such a lot of betters! Father got the"
766 "monitor-medal by being umble. So did I. Father got made a sexton by"
766 "being umble. He had the character, among the gentlefolks, of being"
766 "such a well-behaved man, that they were determined to bring him in. \"Be"
766 "umble, Uriah,\" says father to me, \"and you'll get on. It was what was"
766 "always being dinned into you and me at school; it's what goes down best."
766 "Be umble,\" says father, \"and you'll do!\" And really it ain't done bad!'"
766 ""
766 "It was the first time it had ever occurred to me, that this detestable"
766 "cant of false humility might have originated out of the Heep family. I"
766 "had seen the harvest, but had never thought of the seed."
766 ""
766 "'When I was quite a young boy,' said Uriah, 'I got to know what"
766 "umbleness did, and I took to it. I ate umble pie with an appetite. I"
766 "stopped at the umble point of my learning, and says I, \"Hold hard!\" When"
766 "you offered to teach me Latin, I knew better. \"People like to be above"
766 "you,\" says father, \"keep yourself down.\" I am very umble to the present"
766 "moment, Master Copperfield, but I've got a little power!'"
766 ""
766 "And he said all this--I knew, as I saw his face in the moonlight--that"
766 "I might understand he was resolved to recompense himself by using his"
766 "power. I had never doubted his meanness, his craft and malice; but I"
766 "fully comprehended now, for the first time, what a base, unrelenting,"
766 "and revengeful spirit, must have been engendered by this early, and this"
766 "long, suppression."
766 ""
766 "His account of himself was so far attended with an agreeable result,"
766 "that it led to his withdrawing his hand in order that he might have"
766 "another hug of himself under the chin. Once apart from him, I was"
766 "determined to keep apart; and we walked back, side by side, saying"
766 "very little more by the way. Whether his spirits were elevated by the"
766 "communication I had made to him, or by his having indulged in this"
766 "retrospect, I don't know; but they were raised by some influence. He"
766 "talked more at dinner than was usual with him; asked his mother (off"
766 "duty, from the moment of our re-entering the house) whether he was not"
766 "growing too old for a bachelor; and once looked at Agnes so, that I"
766 "would have given all I had, for leave to knock him down."
766 ""
766 "When we three males were left alone after dinner, he got into a more"
766 "adventurous state. He had taken little or no wine; and I presume it was"
766 "the mere insolence of triumph that was upon him, flushed perhaps by the"
766 "temptation my presence furnished to its exhibition."
766 ""
766 "I had observed yesterday, that he tried to entice Mr. Wickfield to"
766 "drink; and, interpreting the look which Agnes had given me as she went"
766 "out, had limited myself to one glass, and then proposed that we should"
766 "follow her. I would have done so again today; but Uriah was too quick"

766 "effort that he made against it; the struggle between his shame in"
766 "Uriah's deportment, and his desire to conciliate him; the manifest"
766 "exultation with which Uriah twisted and turned, and held him up before"
766 "me. It made me sick at heart to see, and my hand recoils from writing"

766 "head, trying to force me from him, and to force himself from me, not"
766 "answering a word, not looking at or seeing anyone; blindly striving"
766 "for he knew not what, his face all staring and distorted--a frightful"
766 "spectacle."
766 ""
766 "I conjured him, incoherently, but in the most impassioned manner, not"
766 "to abandon himself to this wildness, but to hear me. I besought him to"
766 "think of Agnes, to connect me with Agnes, to recollect how Agnes and I"
766 "had grown up together, how I honoured her and loved her, how she was his"
766 "pride and joy. I tried to bring her idea before him in any form; I even"
766 "reproached him with not having firmness to spare her the knowledge of"
766 "such a scene as this. I may have effected something, or his wildness may"
766 "have spent itself; but by degrees he struggled less, and began to look"
766 "at me--strangely at first, then with recognition in his eyes. At length"
766 "he said, 'I know, Trotwood! My darling child and you--I know! But look"

766 "on my downward way then, but the dreary, dreary road I have traversed"
766 "since! Weak indulgence has ruined me. Indulgence in remembrance, and"
766 "indulgence in forgetfulness. My natural grief for my child's mother"
766 "turned to disease; my natural love for my child turned to disease. I"
766 "have infected everything I touched. I have brought misery on what I"

766 "the moment the weight was taken off. You have no idea what obstinate"
766 "hair mine is, Copperfield. I am quite a fretful porcupine.'"
766 ""
766 "I was a little disappointed, I must confess, but thoroughly charmed by"
766 "his good-nature too. I told him how I esteemed his good-nature; and said"
766 "that his hair must have taken all the obstinacy out of his character,"
766 "for he had none."
766 ""
766 "'Oh!' returned Traddles, laughing. 'I assure you, it's quite an old"
766 "story, my unfortunate hair. My uncle's wife couldn't bear it. She said"
766 "it exasperated her. It stood very much in my way, too, when I first fell"
766 "in love with Sophy. Very much!'"
766 ""
766 "'Did she object to it?'"
766 ""
766 "'SHE didn't,' rejoined Traddles; 'but her eldest sister--the one that's"
766 "the Beauty--quite made game of it, I understand. In fact, all the"
766 "sisters laugh at it.'"
766 ""
766 "'Agreeable!' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' returned Traddles with perfect innocence, 'it's a joke for us."
766 "They pretend that Sophy has a lock of it in her desk, and is obliged to"
766 "shut it in a clasped book, to keep it down. We laugh about it.'"
766 ""
766 "'By the by, my dear Traddles,' said I, 'your experience may suggest"
766 "something to me. When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have"
766 "just mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family? Was there"
766 "anything like--what we are going through today, for instance?' I added,"
766 "nervously."
766 ""
766 "'Why,' replied Traddles, on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade had"
766 "stolen, 'it was rather a painful transaction, Copperfield, in my case."
766 "You see, Sophy being of so much use in the family, none of them could"
766 "endure the thought of her ever being married. Indeed, they had quite"
766 "settled among themselves that she never was to be married, and they"
766 "called her the old maid. Accordingly, when I mentioned it, with the"
766 "greatest precaution, to Mrs. Crewler--'"
766 ""
766 "'The mama?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'The mama,' said Traddles--'Reverend Horace Crewler--when I mentioned it"
766 "with every possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler, the effect upon her was"
766 "such that she gave a scream and became insensible. I couldn't approach"
766 "the subject again, for months.'"
766 ""
766 "'You did at last?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Well, the Reverend Horace did,' said Traddles. 'He is an excellent man,"
766 "most exemplary in every way; and he pointed out to her that she ought,"
766 "as a Christian, to reconcile herself to the sacrifice (especially as it"
766 "was so uncertain), and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me. As to"
766 "myself, Copperfield, I give you my word, I felt a perfect bird of prey"
766 "towards the family.'"
766 ""
766 "'The sisters took your part, I hope, Traddles?'"
766 ""
766 "'Why, I can't say they did,' he returned. 'When we had comparatively"
766 "reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You"
766 "recollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter"
766 "with her spine?'"
766 ""
766 "'Perfectly!'"
766 ""
766 "'She clenched both her hands,' said Traddles, looking at me in dismay;"
766 "'shut her eyes; turned lead-colour; became perfectly stiff; and"
766 "took nothing for two days but toast-and-water, administered with a"
766 "tea-spoon.'"
766 ""
766 "'What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!' I remarked."
766 ""
766 "'Oh, I beg your pardon, Copperfield!' said Traddles. 'She is a very"
766 "charming girl, but she has a great deal of feeling. In fact, they all"
766 "have. Sophy told me afterwards, that the self-reproach she underwent"
766 "while she was in attendance upon Sarah, no words could describe. I know"
766 "it must have been severe, by my own feelings, Copperfield; which were"
766 "like a criminal's. After Sarah was restored, we still had to break it"
766 "to the other eight; and it produced various effects upon them of a most"
766 "pathetic nature. The two little ones, whom Sophy educates, have only"
766 "just left off de-testing me.'"
766 ""
766 "'At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Ye-yes, I should say they were, on the whole, resigned to it,' said"
766 "Traddles, doubtfully. 'The fact is, we avoid mentioning the subject;"
766 "and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great"
766 "consolation to them. There will be a deplorable scene, whenever we"
766 "are married. It will be much more like a funeral, than a wedding. And"
766 "they'll all hate me for taking her away!'"
766 ""
766 "His honest face, as he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his"
766 "head, impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality,"
766 "for I was by this time in a state of such excessive trepidation"
766 "and wandering of mind, as to be quite unable to fix my attention on"
766 "anything. On our approaching the house where the Misses Spenlow lived,"
766 "I was at such a discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of"
766 "mind, that Traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass"
766 "of ale. This having been administered at a neighbouring public-house, he"
766 "conducted me, with tottering steps, to the Misses Spenlow's door."
766 ""
766 "I had a vague sensation of being, as it were, on view, when the maid"
766 "opened it; and of wavering, somehow, across a hall with a weather-glass"
766 "in it, into a quiet little drawing-room on the ground-floor, commanding"
766 "a neat garden. Also of sitting down here, on a sofa, and seeing"
766 "Traddles's hair start up, now his hat was removed, like one of those"
766 "obtrusive little figures made of springs, that fly out of fictitious"
766 "snuff-boxes when the lid is taken off. Also of hearing an old-fashioned"
766 "clock ticking away on the chimney-piece, and trying to make it keep time"
766 "to the jerking of my heart,--which it wouldn't. Also of looking round"
766 "the room for any sign of Dora, and seeing none. Also of thinking that"
766 "Jip once barked in the distance, and was instantly choked by somebody."
766 "Ultimately I found myself backing Traddles into the fireplace, and"
766 "bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies, dressed in"
766 "black, and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of"
766 "the late Mr. Spenlow."
766 ""
766 "'Pray,' said one of the two little ladies, 'be seated.'"
766 ""
766 "When I had done tumbling over Traddles, and had sat upon something which"
766 "was not a cat--my first seat was--I so far recovered my sight, as to"
766 "perceive that Mr. Spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the"
766 "family; that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the"
766 "two sisters; and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the"
766 "conference, inasmuch as she had my letter in her hand--so familiar as"
766 "it looked to me, and yet so odd!--and was referring to it through an"
766 "eye-glass. They were dressed alike, but this sister wore her dress with"
766 "a more youthful air than the other; and perhaps had a trifle more frill,"
766 "or tucker, or brooch, or bracelet, or some little thing of that kind,"
766 "which made her look more lively. They were both upright in their"
766 "carriage, formal, precise, composed, and quiet. The sister who had"
766 "not my letter, had her arms crossed on her breast, and resting on each"
766 "other, like an Idol."
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Copperfield, I believe,' said the sister who had got my letter,"
766 "addressing herself to Traddles."
766 ""
766 "This was a frightful beginning. Traddles had to indicate that I was Mr."
766 "Copperfield, and I had to lay claim to myself, and they had to divest"
766 "themselves of a preconceived opinion that Traddles was Mr. Copperfield,"
766 "and altogether we were in a nice condition. To improve it, we all"
766 "distinctly heard Jip give two short barks, and receive another choke."
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Copperfield!' said the sister with the letter."
766 ""
766 "I did something--bowed, I suppose--and was all attention, when the other"
766 "sister struck in."
766 ""
766 "'My sister Lavinia,' said she 'being conversant with matters of this"
766 "nature, will state what we consider most calculated to promote the"
766 "happiness of both parties.'"
766 ""
766 "I discovered afterwards that Miss Lavinia was an authority in affairs"
766 "of the heart, by reason of there having anciently existed a certain Mr."
766 "Pidger, who played short whist, and was supposed to have been enamoured"
766 "of her. My private opinion is, that this was entirely a gratuitous"
766 "assumption, and that Pidger was altogether innocent of any such"
766 "sentiments--to which he had never given any sort of expression that"
766 "I could ever hear of. Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa had a"
766 "superstition, however, that he would have declared his passion, if he"
766 "had not been cut short in his youth (at about sixty) by over-drinking"
766 "his constitution, and over-doing an attempt to set it right again by"
766 "swilling Bath water. They had a lurking suspicion even, that he died of"
766 "secret love; though I must say there was a picture of him in the house"
766 "with a damask nose, which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed"
766 "upon."
766 ""
766 "'We will not,' said Miss Lavinia, 'enter on the past history of this"
766 "matter. Our poor brother Francis's death has cancelled that.'"
766 ""
766 "'We had not,' said Miss Clarissa, 'been in the habit of frequent"
766 "association with our brother Francis; but there was no decided division"
766 "or disunion between us. Francis took his road; we took ours. We"
766 "considered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should"
766 "be so. And it was so.'"
766 ""
766 "Each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak, shook her head"
766 "after speaking, and became upright again when silent. Miss Clarissa"
766 "never moved her arms. She sometimes played tunes upon them with her"
766 "fingers--minuets and marches I should think--but never moved them."
766 ""
766 "'Our niece's position, or supposed position, is much changed by our"
766 "brother Francis's death,' said Miss Lavinia; 'and therefore we consider"
766 "our brother's opinions as regarded her position as being changed too. We"
766 "have no reason to doubt, Mr. Copperfield, that you are a young gentleman"
766 "possessed of good qualities and honourable character; or that you have"
766 "an affection--or are fully persuaded that you have an affection--for our"
766 "niece.'"
766 ""
766 "I replied, as I usually did whenever I had a chance, that nobody had"
766 "ever loved anybody else as I loved Dora. Traddles came to my assistance"
766 "with a confirmatory murmur."
766 ""
766 "Miss Lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder, when Miss Clarissa,"
766 "who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother"
766 "Francis, struck in again:"
766 ""
766 "'If Dora's mama,' she said, 'when she married our brother Francis, had"
766 "at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinner-table,"
766 "it would have been better for the happiness of all parties.'"
766 ""
766 "'Sister Clarissa,' said Miss Lavinia. 'Perhaps we needn't mind that"
766 "now.'"
766 ""
766 "'Sister Lavinia,' said Miss Clarissa, 'it belongs to the subject. With"
766 "your branch of the subject, on which alone you are competent to speak, I"
766 "should not think of interfering. On this branch of the subject I have a"
766 "voice and an opinion. It would have been better for the happiness of"
766 "all parties, if Dora's mama, when she married our brother Francis, had"
766 "mentioned plainly what her intentions were. We should then have known"
766 "what we had to expect. We should have said \"Pray do not invite us,"
766 "at any time\"; and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been"
766 "avoided.'"
766 ""
766 "When Miss Clarissa had shaken her head, Miss Lavinia resumed: again"
766 "referring to my letter through her eye-glass. They both had little"
766 "bright round twinkling eyes, by the way, which were like birds' eyes."
766 "They were not unlike birds, altogether; having a sharp, brisk, sudden"
766 "manner, and a little short, spruce way of adjusting themselves, like"
766 "canaries."
766 ""
766 "Miss Lavinia, as I have said, resumed:"
766 ""
766 "'You ask permission of my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield,"
766 "to visit here, as the accepted suitor of our niece.'"
766 ""
766 "'If our brother Francis,' said Miss Clarissa, breaking out again, if I"
766 "may call anything so calm a breaking out, 'wished to surround himself"
766 "with an atmosphere of Doctors' Commons, and of Doctors' Commons only,"
766 "what right or desire had we to object? None, I am sure. We have ever"
766 "been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone. But why not say"
766 "so? Let our brother Francis and his wife have their society. Let"
766 "my sister Lavinia and myself have our society. We can find it for"
766 "ourselves, I hope.'"
766 ""
766 "As this appeared to be addressed to Traddles and me, both Traddles and"
766 "I made some sort of reply. Traddles was inaudible. I think I observed,"
766 "myself, that it was highly creditable to all concerned. I don't in the"
766 "least know what I meant."
766 ""
766 "'Sister Lavinia,' said Miss Clarissa, having now relieved her mind, 'you"
766 "can go on, my dear.'"
766 ""
766 "Miss Lavinia proceeded:"
766 ""
766 "'Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been very careful"
766 "indeed in considering this letter; and we have not considered it without"
766 "finally showing it to our niece, and discussing it with our niece. We"
766 "have no doubt that you think you like her very much.'"
766 ""
766 "'Think, ma'am,' I rapturously began, 'oh!--'"
766 ""
766 "But Miss Clarissa giving me a look (just like a sharp canary), as"
766 "requesting that I would not interrupt the oracle, I begged pardon."
766 ""
766 "'Affection,' said Miss Lavinia, glancing at her sister for"
766 "corroboration, which she gave in the form of a little nod to every"
766 "clause, 'mature affection, homage, devotion, does not easily express"
766 "itself. Its voice is low. It is modest and retiring, it lies in ambush,"
766 "waits and waits. Such is the mature fruit. Sometimes a life glides away,"
766 "and finds it still ripening in the shade.'"
766 ""
766 "Of course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her"
766 "supposed experience of the stricken Pidger; but I saw, from the gravity"
766 "with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head, that great weight was attached"
766 "to these words."
766 ""
766 "'The light--for I call them, in comparison with such sentiments, the"
766 "light--inclinations of very young people,' pursued Miss Lavinia, 'are"
766 "dust, compared to rocks. It is owing to the difficulty of knowing"
766 "whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation, that"
766 "my sister Clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act, Mr."
766 "Copperfield, and Mr.--'"
766 ""
766 "'Traddles,' said my friend, finding himself looked at."
766 ""
766 "'I beg pardon. Of the Inner Temple, I believe?' said Miss Clarissa,"
766 "again glancing at my letter."
766 ""
766 "Traddles said 'Exactly so,' and became pretty red in the face."
766 ""
766 "Now, although I had not received any express encouragement as yet, I"
766 "fancied that I saw in the two little sisters, and particularly in Miss"
766 "Lavinia, an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of"
766 "domestic interest, a settling down to make the most of it, a disposition"
766 "to pet it, in which there was a good bright ray of hope. I thought"
766 "I perceived that Miss Lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in"
766 "superintending two young lovers, like Dora and me; and that Miss"
766 "Clarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend"
766 "us, and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject"
766 "whenever that impulse was strong upon her. This gave me courage to"
766 "protest most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell, or"
766 "anyone believe; that all my friends knew how I loved her; that my aunt,"
766 "Agnes, Traddles, everyone who knew me, knew how I loved her, and how"
766 "earnest my love had made me. For the truth of this, I appealed to"
766 "Traddles. And Traddles, firing up as if he were plunging into a"
766 "Parliamentary Debate, really did come out nobly: confirming me in good"
766 "round terms, and in a plain sensible practical manner, that evidently"
766 "made a favourable impression."
766 ""
766 "'I speak, if I may presume to say so, as one who has some little"
766 "experience of such things,' said Traddles, 'being myself engaged to a"
766 "young lady--one of ten, down in Devonshire--and seeing no probability,"
766 "at present, of our engagement coming to a termination.'"
766 ""
766 "'You may be able to confirm what I have said, Mr. Traddles,' observed"
766 "Miss Lavinia, evidently taking a new interest in him, 'of the affection"
766 "that is modest and retiring; that waits and waits?'"
766 ""
766 "'Entirely, ma'am,' said Traddles."
766 ""
766 "Miss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia, and shook her head gravely. Miss"
766 "Lavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa, and heaved a little sigh."
766 "'Sister Lavinia,' said Miss Clarissa, 'take my smelling-bottle.'"
766 ""
766 "Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic"
766 "vinegar--Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while; and"
766 "then went on to say, rather faintly:"
766 ""
766 "'My sister and myself have been in great doubt, Mr. Traddles, what"
766 "course we ought to take in reference to the likings, or imaginary"
766 "likings, of such very young people as your friend Mr. Copperfield and"
766 "our niece.'"
766 ""
766 "'Our brother Francis's child,' remarked Miss Clarissa. 'If our brother"
766 "Francis's wife had found it convenient in her lifetime (though she had"
766 "an unquestionable right to act as she thought best) to invite the family"
766 "to her dinner-table, we might have known our brother Francis's child"
766 "better at the present moment. Sister Lavinia, proceed.'"
766 ""
766 "Miss Lavinia turned my letter, so as to bring the superscription towards"

766 "'It seems to us,' said she, 'prudent, Mr. Traddles, to bring these"
766 "feelings to the test of our own observation. At present we know nothing"
766 "of them, and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there"
766 "may be in them. Therefore we are inclined so far to accede to Mr."
766 "Copperfield's proposal, as to admit his visits here.'"
766 ""
766 "'I shall never, dear ladies,' I exclaimed, relieved of an immense load"
766 "of apprehension, 'forget your kindness!'"

766 "'But,' pursued Miss Lavinia,--'but, we would prefer to regard those"
766 "visits, Mr. Traddles, as made, at present, to us. We must guard"

766 "'Nothing!' cried I. 'I am deeply sensible of it.'"
766 ""
766 "'In this position of affairs,' said Miss Lavinia, again referring to"
766 "her notes, 'and admitting his visits on this understanding only, we"
766 "must require from Mr. Copperfield a distinct assurance, on his word of"
766 "honour, that no communication of any kind shall take place between him"
766 "and our niece without our knowledge. That no project whatever shall be"
766 "entertained with regard to our niece, without being first submitted to"
766 "us--' 'To you, sister Lavinia,' Miss Clarissa interposed."
766 ""
766 "'Be it so, Clarissa!' assented Miss Lavinia resignedly--'to me--and"
766 "receiving our concurrence. We must make this a most express and serious"
766 "stipulation, not to be broken on any account. We wished Mr. Copperfield"
766 "to be accompanied by some confidential friend today,' with an"
766 "inclination of her head towards Traddles, who bowed, 'in order that"
766 "there might be no doubt or misconception on this subject. If Mr."
766 "Copperfield, or if you, Mr. Traddles, feel the least scruple, in giving"
766 "this promise, I beg you to take time to consider it.'"
766 ""
766 "I exclaimed, in a state of high ecstatic fervour, that not a moment's"
766 "consideration could be necessary. I bound myself by the required"
766 "promise, in a most impassioned manner; called upon Traddles to witness"
766 "it; and denounced myself as the most atrocious of characters if I ever"
766 "swerved from it in the least degree."
766 ""
766 "'Stay!' said Miss Lavinia, holding up her hand; 'we resolved, before we"

766 "for a quarter of an hour, to consider this point. You will allow us to"
766 "retire.'"
766 ""
766 "It was in vain for me to say that no consideration was necessary. They"

766 "little birds hopped out with great dignity; leaving me to receive the"
766 "congratulations of Traddles, and to feel as if I were translated to"
766 "regions of exquisite happiness. Exactly at the expiration of the"
766 "quarter of an hour, they reappeared with no less dignity than they had"
766 "disappeared. They had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were"
766 "made of autumn-leaves: and they came rustling back, in like manner."

766 "I then bound myself once more to the prescribed conditions."
766 ""

766 "I was wonderfully relieved to find that my aunt and Dora's aunts"
766 "rubbed on, all things considered, much more smoothly than I could have"
766 "expected. My aunt made her promised visit within a few days of the"
766 "conference; and within a few more days, Dora's aunts called upon her,"
766 "in due state and form. Similar but more friendly exchanges took place"
766 "afterwards, usually at intervals of three or four weeks. I know that my"
766 "aunt distressed Dora's aunts very much, by utterly setting at naught the"
766 "dignity of fly-conveyance, and walking out to Putney at extraordinary"
766 "times, as shortly after breakfast or just before tea; likewise by"
766 "wearing her bonnet in any manner that happened to be comfortable to her"
766 "head, without at all deferring to the prejudices of civilization on that"
766 "subject. But Dora's aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric"
766 "and somewhat masculine lady, with a strong understanding; and although"
766 "my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of Dora's aunts, by expressing"
766 "heretical opinions on various points of ceremony, she loved me too"
766 "well not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general"
766 "harmony."

766 "The only member of our small society who positively refused to adapt"
766 "himself to circumstances, was Jip. He never saw my aunt without"
766 "immediately displaying every tooth in his head, retiring under a chair,"
766 "and growling incessantly: with now and then a doleful howl, as if she"
766 "really were too much for his feelings. All kinds of treatment were tried"
766 "with him, coaxing, scolding, slapping, bringing him to Buckingham"
766 "Street (where he instantly dashed at the two cats, to the terror of all"
766 "beholders); but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my"
766 "aunt's society. He would sometimes think he had got the better of his"
766 "objection, and be amiable for a few minutes; and then would put up his"
766 "snub nose, and howl to that extent, that there was nothing for it but"
766 "to blind him and put him in the plate-warmer. At length, Dora regularly"
766 "muffled him in a towel and shut him up there, whenever my aunt was"
766 "reported at the door."
766 ""
766 "One thing troubled me much, after we had fallen into this quiet train."
766 "It was, that Dora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy"
766 "or plaything. My aunt, with whom she gradually became familiar, always"
766 "called her Little Blossom; and the pleasure of Miss Lavinia's life was"
766 "to wait upon her, curl her hair, make ornaments for her, and treat her"
766 "like a pet child. What Miss Lavinia did, her sister did as a matter of"
766 "course. It was very odd to me; but they all seemed to treat Dora, in her"
766 "degree, much as Dora treated Jip in his."
766 ""
766 "I made up my mind to speak to Dora about this; and one day when we were"
766 "out walking (for we were licensed by Miss Lavinia, after a while, to"
766 "go out walking by ourselves), I said to her that I wished she could get"
766 "them to behave towards her differently."

766 "be treated rationally.'"
766 ""
766 "Dora gave me a reproachful look--the prettiest look!--and then began to"
766 "sob, saying, if I didn't like her, why had I ever wanted so much to be"
766 "engaged to her? And why didn't I go away, now, if I couldn't bear her?"
766 ""
766 "What could I do, but kiss away her tears, and tell her how I doted on"

766 "'I am sure I am very affectionate,' said Dora; 'you oughtn't to be cruel"
766 "to me, Doady!'"
766 ""
766 "'Cruel, my precious love! As if I would--or could--be cruel to you, for"
766 "the world!'"
766 ""
766 "'Then don't find fault with me,' said Dora, making a rosebud of her"
766 "mouth; 'and I'll be good.'"
766 ""
766 "I was charmed by her presently asking me, of her own accord, to give"
766 "her that cookery-book I had once spoken of, and to show her how to keep"
766 "accounts as I had once promised I would. I brought the volume with me on"
766 "my next visit (I got it prettily bound, first, to make it look less dry"
766 "and more inviting); and as we strolled about the Common, I showed her an"
766 "old housekeeping-book of my aunt's, and gave her a set of tablets, and"
766 "a pretty little pencil-case and box of leads, to practise housekeeping"
766 "with."
766 ""
766 "But the cookery-book made Dora's head ache, and the figures made her"
766 "cry. They wouldn't add up, she said. So she rubbed them out, and drew"
766 "little nosegays and likenesses of me and Jip, all over the tablets."
766 ""
766 "Then I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters, as we"
766 "walked about on a Saturday afternoon. Sometimes, for example, when we"
766 "passed a butcher's shop, I would say:"
766 ""
766 "'Now suppose, my pet, that we were married, and you were going to buy a"
766 "shoulder of mutton for dinner, would you know how to buy it?'"
766 ""
766 "My pretty little Dora's face would fall, and she would make her mouth"
766 "into a bud again, as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with a"
766 "kiss."
766 ""
766 "'Would you know how to buy it, my darling?' I would repeat, perhaps, if"
766 "I were very inflexible."
766 ""
766 "Dora would think a little, and then reply, perhaps, with great triumph:"
766 ""
766 "'Why, the butcher would know how to sell it, and what need I know? Oh,"
766 "you silly boy!'"
766 ""
766 "So, when I once asked Dora, with an eye to the cookery-book, what she"
766 "would do, if we were married, and I were to say I should like a nice"
766 "Irish stew, she replied that she would tell the servant to make it; and"
766 "then clapped her little hands together across my arm, and laughed in"
766 "such a charming manner that she was more delightful than ever."
766 ""
766 "Consequently, the principal use to which the cookery-book was devoted,"
766 "was being put down in the corner for Jip to stand upon. But Dora was so"
766 "pleased, when she had trained him to stand upon it without offering to"
766 "come off, and at the same time to hold the pencil-case in his mouth,"
766 "that I was very glad I had bought it."
766 ""
766 "And we fell back on the guitar-case, and the flower-painting, and the"
766 "songs about never leaving off dancing, Ta ra la! and were as happy as"
766 "the week was long. I occasionally wished I could venture to hint to Miss"
766 "Lavinia, that she treated the darling of my heart a little too much like"
766 "a plaything; and I sometimes awoke, as it were, wondering to find that"
766 "I had fallen into the general fault, and treated her like a plaything"
766 "too--but not often."

766 ""
766 "I feel as if it were not for me to record, even though this manuscript"
766 "is intended for no eyes but mine, how hard I worked at that tremendous"
766 "short-hand, and all improvement appertaining to it, in my sense of"
766 "responsibility to Dora and her aunts. I will only add, to what I have"
766 "already written of my perseverance at this time of my life, and of a"
766 "patient and continuous energy which then began to be matured within me,"
766 "and which I know to be the strong part of my character, if it have any"
766 "strength at all, that there, on looking back, I find the source of my"
766 "success. I have been very fortunate in worldly matters; many men have"
766 "worked much harder, and not succeeded half so well; but I never could"
766 "have done what I have done, without the habits of punctuality, order,"
766 "and diligence, without the determination to concentrate myself on one"
766 "object at a time, no matter how quickly its successor should come upon"
766 "its heels, which I then formed. Heaven knows I write this, in no spirit"
766 "of self-laudation. The man who reviews his own life, as I do mine,"
766 "in going on here, from page to page, had need to have been a good man"
766 "indeed, if he would be spared the sharp consciousness of many talents"
766 "neglected, many opportunities wasted, many erratic and perverted"
766 "feelings constantly at war within his breast, and defeating him. I"
766 "do not hold one natural gift, I dare say, that I have not abused. My"
766 "meaning simply is, that whatever I have tried to do in life, I have"
766 "tried with all my heart to do well; that whatever I have devoted myself"
766 "to, I have devoted myself to completely; that in great aims and in"
766 "small, I have always been thoroughly in earnest. I have never believed"
766 "it possible that any natural or improved ability can claim immunity from"
766 "the companionship of the steady, plain, hard-working qualities, and"
766 "hope to gain its end. There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this"
766 "earth. Some happy talent, and some fortunate opportunity, may form the"
766 "two sides of the ladder on which some men mount, but the rounds of that"
766 "ladder must be made of stuff to stand wear and tear; and there is no"
766 "substitute for thorough-going, ardent, and sincere earnestness. Never"
766 "to put one hand to anything, on which I could throw my whole self; and"
766 "never to affect depreciation of my work, whatever it was; I find, now,"

766 "the remonstrances of Miss Lavinia, would come running out once more to"
766 "remind Agnes at the coach window about writing, and to shake her curls"

766 ""
766 "Although I think I had never really feared it, in any season of cool"

766 "you can ever give me help, rely upon it I will ask you for it. God"
766 "bless you always!' In her beaming smile, and in these last tones of her"
766 "cheerful voice, I seemed again to see and hear my little Dora in her"
766 "company. I stood awhile, looking through the porch at the stars, with"
766 "a heart full of love and gratitude, and then walked slowly forth. I had"
766 "engaged a bed at a decent alehouse close by, and was going out at the"
766 "gate, when, happening to turn my head, I saw a light in the Doctor's"
766 "study. A half-reproachful fancy came into my mind, that he had been"
766 "working at the Dictionary without my help. With the view of seeing if"
766 "this were so, and, in any case, of bidding him good night, if he were"
766 "yet sitting among his books, I turned back, and going softly across the"
766 "hall, and gently opening the door, looked in."
766 ""
766 "The first person whom I saw, to my surprise, by the sober light of the"
766 "shaded lamp, was Uriah. He was standing close beside it, with one of"
766 "his skeleton hands over his mouth, and the other resting on the Doctor's"
766 "table. The Doctor sat in his study chair, covering his face with his"
766 "hands. Mr. Wickfield, sorely troubled and distressed, was leaning"
766 "forward, irresolutely touching the Doctor's arm."
766 ""
766 "For an instant, I supposed that the Doctor was ill. I hastily advanced a"
766 "step under that impression, when I met Uriah's eye, and saw what was the"
766 "matter. I would have withdrawn, but the Doctor made a gesture to detain"
766 "me, and I remained."
766 ""
766 "'At any rate,' observed Uriah, with a writhe of his ungainly person, 'we"
766 "may keep the door shut. We needn't make it known to ALL the town.'"
766 ""
766 "Saying which, he went on his toes to the door, which I had left open,"
766 "and carefully closed it. He then came back, and took up his former"
766 "position. There was an obtrusive show of compassionate zeal in his voice"
766 "and manner, more intolerable--at least to me--than any demeanour he"
766 "could have assumed."
766 ""
766 "'I have felt it incumbent upon me, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah, 'to"
766 "point out to Doctor Strong what you and me have already talked about."
766 "You didn't exactly understand me, though?'"
766 ""
766 "I gave him a look, but no other answer; and, going to my good old"
766 "master, said a few words that I meant to be words of comfort and"
766 "encouragement. He put his hand upon my shoulder, as it had been his"
766 "custom to do when I was quite a little fellow, but did not lift his grey"
766 "head."
766 ""
766 "'As you didn't understand me, Master Copperfield,' resumed Uriah in"
766 "the same officious manner, 'I may take the liberty of umbly mentioning,"
766 "being among friends, that I have called Doctor Strong's attention to the"
766 "goings-on of Mrs. Strong. It's much against the grain with me, I assure"
766 "you, Copperfield, to be concerned in anything so unpleasant; but really,"
766 "as it is, we're all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn't to be. That"
766 "was what my meaning was, sir, when you didn't understand me.' I wonder"
766 "now, when I recall his leer, that I did not collar him, and try to shake"
766 "the breath out of his body."
766 ""
766 "'I dare say I didn't make myself very clear,' he went on, 'nor you"
766 "neither. Naturally, we was both of us inclined to give such a subject"
766 "a wide berth. Hows'ever, at last I have made up my mind to speak plain;"
766 "and I have mentioned to Doctor Strong that--did you speak, sir?'"
766 ""
766 "This was to the Doctor, who had moaned. The sound might have touched any"
766 "heart, I thought, but it had no effect upon Uriah's."
766 ""
766 "'--mentioned to Doctor Strong,' he proceeded, 'that anyone may see that"
766 "Mr. Maldon, and the lovely and agreeable lady as is Doctor Strong's"
766 "wife, are too sweet on one another. Really the time is come (we being at"
766 "present all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn't to be), when Doctor"
766 "Strong must be told that this was full as plain to everybody as the sun,"
766 "before Mr. Maldon went to India; that Mr. Maldon made excuses to come"
766 "back, for nothing else; and that he's always here, for nothing else."
766 "When you come in, sir, I was just putting it to my fellow-partner,'"
766 "towards whom he turned, 'to say to Doctor Strong upon his word and"
766 "honour, whether he'd ever been of this opinion long ago, or not. Come,"
766 "Mr. Wickfield, sir! Would you be so good as tell us? Yes or no, sir?"
766 "Come, partner!'"
766 ""
766 "'For God's sake, my dear Doctor,' said Mr. Wickfield again laying his"
766 "irresolute hand upon the Doctor's arm, 'don't attach too much weight to"
766 "any suspicions I may have entertained.'"
766 ""
766 "'There!' cried Uriah, shaking his head. 'What a melancholy confirmation:"
766 "ain't it? Him! Such an old friend! Bless your soul, when I was nothing"
766 "but a clerk in his office, Copperfield, I've seen him twenty times, if"
766 "I've seen him once, quite in a taking about it--quite put out, you know"
766 "(and very proper in him as a father; I'm sure I can't blame him), to"
766 "think that Miss Agnes was mixing herself up with what oughtn't to be.'"
766 ""
766 "'My dear Strong,' said Mr. Wickfield in a tremulous voice, 'my good"
766 "friend, I needn't tell you that it has been my vice to look for some one"
766 "master motive in everybody, and to try all actions by one narrow test. I"
766 "may have fallen into such doubts as I have had, through this mistake.'"
766 ""
766 "'You have had doubts, Wickfield,' said the Doctor, without lifting up"
766 "his head. 'You have had doubts.'"
766 ""
766 "'Speak up, fellow-partner,' urged Uriah."
766 ""
766 "'I had, at one time, certainly,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'I--God forgive"
766 "me--I thought YOU had.'"
766 ""
766 "'No, no, no!' returned the Doctor, in a tone of most pathetic grief."
766 "'I thought, at one time,' said Mr. Wickfield, 'that you wished to send"
766 "Maldon abroad to effect a desirable separation.'"
766 ""
766 "'No, no, no!' returned the Doctor. 'To give Annie pleasure, by making"
766 "some provision for the companion of her childhood. Nothing else.'"
766 ""
766 "'So I found,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'I couldn't doubt it, when you told"
766 "me so. But I thought--I implore you to remember the narrow construction"
766 "which has been my besetting sin--that, in a case where there was so much"
766 "disparity in point of years--'"
766 ""
766 "'That's the way to put it, you see, Master Copperfield!' observed Uriah,"
766 "with fawning and offensive pity."
766 ""
766 "'--a lady of such youth, and such attractions, however real her"
766 "respect for you, might have been influenced in marrying, by worldly"
766 "considerations only. I make no allowance for innumerable feelings"
766 "and circumstances that may have all tended to good. For Heaven's sake"
766 "remember that!'"
766 ""
766 "'How kind he puts it!' said Uriah, shaking his head."

766 "'Always observing her from one point of view,' said Mr. Wickfield; 'but"
766 "by all that is dear to you, my old friend, I entreat you to consider"
766 "what it was; I am forced to confess now, having no escape-'"
766 ""
766 "'No! There's no way out of it, Mr. Wickfield, sir,' observed Uriah,"
766 "'when it's got to this.'"

766 "'--that I did,' said Mr. Wickfield, glancing helplessly and distractedly"
766 "at his partner, 'that I did doubt her, and think her wanting in her"
766 "duty to you; and that I did sometimes, if I must say all, feel averse"
766 "to Agnes being in such a familiar relation towards her, as to see what I"
766 "saw, or in my diseased theory fancied that I saw. I never mentioned"
766 "this to anyone. I never meant it to be known to anyone. And though it"
766 "is terrible to you to hear,' said Mr. Wickfield, quite subdued, 'if you"
766 "knew how terrible it is for me to tell, you would feel compassion for"
766 "me!'"
766 ""
766 "The Doctor, in the perfect goodness of his nature, put out his hand. Mr."
766 "Wickfield held it for a little while in his, with his head bowed down."
766 ""
766 "'I am sure,' said Uriah, writhing himself into the silence like a"
766 "Conger-eel, 'that this is a subject full of unpleasantness to everybody."
766 "But since we have got so far, I ought to take the liberty of mentioning"
766 "that Copperfield has noticed it too.'"

766 "I turned upon him, and asked him how he dared refer to me!"
766 ""
766 "'Oh! it's very kind of you, Copperfield,' returned Uriah, undulating all"
766 "over, 'and we all know what an amiable character yours is; but you know"
766 "that the moment I spoke to you the other night, you knew what I meant."
766 "You know you knew what I meant, Copperfield. Don't deny it! You deny it"
766 "with the best intentions; but don't do it, Copperfield.'"

766 "We were silent again, and remained so, until the Doctor rose and walked"
766 "twice or thrice across the room. Presently he returned to where his"

766 "his handkerchief to his eyes, with a simple honesty that did him more"

766 "quite unaccustomed to observe; and I cannot but believe that the"

766 "what might have been, but for me, is, I fear, too true. Much that I have"
766 "seen, but not noted, has come back upon me with new meaning, during"

766 "establishment. Another happy evening, quite as unreal as all the rest"
766 "of it, and I steal into the usual room before going away. Dora is not"
766 "there. I suppose they have not done trying on yet. Miss Lavinia peeps"

766 "delightful state of confusion for a minute or two, to be admired; and"
766 "then takes off her bonnet--looking so natural without it!--and runs away"
766 "with it in her hand; and comes dancing down again in her own familiar"

766 "It was a strange condition of things, the honeymoon being over, and the"
766 "bridesmaids gone home, when I found myself sitting down in my own"
766 "small house with Dora; quite thrown out of employment, as I may say, in"
766 "respect of the delicious old occupation of making love."
766 ""
766 "It seemed such an extraordinary thing to have Dora always there. It was"
766 "so unaccountable not to be obliged to go out to see her, not to have any"
766 "occasion to be tormenting myself about her, not to have to write to her,"
766 "not to be scheming and devising opportunities of being alone with her."
766 "Sometimes of an evening, when I looked up from my writing, and saw her"
766 "seated opposite, I would lean back in my chair, and think how queer it"
766 "was that there we were, alone together as a matter of course--nobody's"
766 "business any more--all the romance of our engagement put away upon a"
766 "shelf, to rust--no one to please but one another--one another to please,"
766 "for life."
766 ""
766 "When there was a debate, and I was kept out very late, it seemed so"

766 "was such a wonderful thing, at first, to have her coming softly down to"
766 "talk to me as I ate my supper. It was such a stupendous thing to know"
766 "for certain that she put her hair in papers. It was altogether such an"
766 "astonishing event to see her do it!"
766 ""
766 "I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping"
766 "house, than I and my pretty Dora did. We had a servant, of course. She"
766 "kept house for us. I have still a latent belief that she must have been"
766 "Mrs. Crupp's daughter in disguise, we had such an awful time of it with"
766 "Mary Anne."
766 ""
766 "Her name was Paragon. Her nature was represented to us, when we engaged"
766 "her, as being feebly expressed in her name. She had a written character,"
766 "as large as a proclamation; and, according to this document, could do"
766 "everything of a domestic nature that ever I heard of, and a great many"
766 "things that I never did hear of. She was a woman in the prime of life;"
766 "of a severe countenance; and subject (particularly in the arms) to"
766 "a sort of perpetual measles or fiery rash. She had a cousin in the"
766 "Life-Guards, with such long legs that he looked like the afternoon"
766 "shadow of somebody else. His shell-jacket was as much too little for him"
766 "as he was too big for the premises. He made the cottage smaller than it"
766 "need have been, by being so very much out of proportion to it. Besides"
766 "which, the walls were not thick, and, whenever he passed the evening at"
766 "our house, we always knew of it by hearing one continual growl in the"
766 "kitchen."
766 ""
766 "Our treasure was warranted sober and honest. I am therefore willing to"
766 "believe that she was in a fit when we found her under the boiler; and"
766 "that the deficient tea-spoons were attributable to the dustman."
766 ""
766 "But she preyed upon our minds dreadfully. We felt our inexperience, and"
766 "were unable to help ourselves. We should have been at her mercy, if she"

766 "being on my knee, she traced them with her pencil; putting it to her"
766 "rosy lips to make it mark blacker, and working at my forehead with a"
766 "quaint little mockery of being industrious, that quite delighted me in"
766 "spite of myself."

766 "us talk sensibly. You know, dear'; what a little hand it was to hold,"
766 "and what a tiny wedding-ring it was to see! 'You know, my love, it is"

766 "turns up and down the room in my uncertainty, and came back again."

766 "gave me courage to be grave."
766 ""
766 "'Now, my own Dora,' said I, 'you are very childish, and are talking"
766 "nonsense. You must remember, I am sure, that I was obliged to go out"
766 "yesterday when dinner was half over; and that, the day before, I was"
766 "made quite unwell by being obliged to eat underdone veal in a hurry;"
766 "today, I don't dine at all--and I am afraid to say how long we waited"
766 "for breakfast--and then the water didn't boil. I don't mean to reproach"

766 "and distracted by self-accusatory inclinations to knock my head against"
766 "the door. I sat down again, and said:"

766 "'I am not blaming you, Dora. We have both a great deal to learn. I am"
766 "only trying to show you, my dear, that you must--you really must' (I"

766 "Anne. Likewise to act a little for yourself, and me.'"
766 ""
766 "'I wonder, I do, at your making such ungrateful speeches,' sobbed Dora."

766 "bit of fish, I went out myself, miles and miles, and ordered it, to"
766 "surprise you.'"

766 "'And it was very kind of you, my own darling,' said I. 'I felt it so"
766 "much that I wouldn't on any account have even mentioned that you"
766 "bought a Salmon--which was too much for two. Or that it cost one pound"
766 "six--which was more than we can afford.'"
766 ""
766 "'You enjoyed it very much,' sobbed Dora. 'And you said I was a Mouse.'"
766 ""
766 "'And I'll say so again, my love,' I returned, 'a thousand times!'"
766 ""
766 "But I had wounded Dora's soft little heart, and she was not to be"
766 "comforted. She was so pathetic in her sobbing and bewailing, that I felt"
766 "as if I had said I don't know what to hurt her. I was obliged to hurry"
766 "away; I was kept out late; and I felt all night such pangs of remorse as"

766 "So we went on. Dora was hardly less affectionate to my aunt than to me,"
766 "and often told her of the time when she was afraid she was 'a cross old"
766 "thing'. I never saw my aunt unbend more systematically to anyone. She"
766 "courted Jip, though Jip never responded; listened, day after day, to the"
766 "guitar, though I am afraid she had no taste for music; never attacked"
766 "the Incapables, though the temptation must have been severe; went"
766 "wonderful distances on foot to purchase, as surprises, any trifles that"
766 "she found out Dora wanted; and never came in by the garden, and missed"
766 "her from the room, but she would call out, at the foot of the stairs, in"
766 "a voice that sounded cheerfully all over the house:"

766 "It was some time now, since I had left the Doctor. Living in his"
766 "neighbourhood, I saw him frequently; and we all went to his house on two"
766 "or three occasions to dinner or tea. The Old Soldier was in permanent"
766 "quarters under the Doctor's roof. She was exactly the same as ever, and"
766 "the same immortal butterflies hovered over her cap."
766 ""
766 "Like some other mothers, whom I have known in the course of my life,"
766 "Mrs. Markleham was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter was."
766 "She required a great deal of amusement, and, like a deep old soldier,"
766 "pretended, in consulting her own inclinations, to be devoting herself"
766 "to her child. The Doctor's desire that Annie should be entertained,"
766 "was therefore particularly acceptable to this excellent parent; who"
766 "expressed unqualified approval of his discretion."
766 ""
766 "I have no doubt, indeed, that she probed the Doctor's wound without"
766 "knowing it. Meaning nothing but a certain matured frivolity and"
766 "selfishness, not always inseparable from full-blown years, I think she"
766 "confirmed him in his fear that he was a constraint upon his young"
766 "wife, and that there was no congeniality of feeling between them, by so"
766 "strongly commending his design of lightening the load of her life."
766 ""
766 "'My dear soul,' she said to him one day when I was present, 'you know"
766 "there is no doubt it would be a little pokey for Annie to be always shut"
766 "up here.'"
766 ""
766 "The Doctor nodded his benevolent head. 'When she comes to her mother's"
766 "age,' said Mrs. Markleham, with a flourish of her fan, 'then it'll be"
766 "another thing. You might put ME into a Jail, with genteel society and"
766 "a rubber, and I should never care to come out. But I am not Annie, you"
766 "know; and Annie is not her mother.'"
766 ""
766 "'Surely, surely,' said the Doctor."
766 ""
766 "'You are the best of creatures--no, I beg your pardon!' for the Doctor"
766 "made a gesture of deprecation, 'I must say before your face, as I always"
766 "say behind your back, you are the best of creatures; but of course you"
766 "don't--now do you?---enter into the same pursuits and fancies as Annie?'"
766 ""
766 "'No,' said the Doctor, in a sorrowful tone."
766 ""
766 "'No, of course not,' retorted the Old Soldier. 'Take your Dictionary,"
766 "for example. What a useful work a Dictionary is! What a necessary work!"
766 "The meanings of words! Without Doctor Johnson, or somebody of that sort,"
766 "we might have been at this present moment calling an Italian-iron,"
766 "a bedstead. But we can't expect a Dictionary--especially when it's"
766 "making--to interest Annie, can we?'"
766 ""
766 "The Doctor shook his head."
766 ""
766 "'And that's why I so much approve,' said Mrs. Markleham, tapping him"
766 "on the shoulder with her shut-up fan, 'of your thoughtfulness. It shows"
766 "that you don't expect, as many elderly people do expect, old heads on"
766 "young shoulders. You have studied Annie's character, and you understand"
766 "it. That's what I find so charming!'"
766 ""
766 "Even the calm and patient face of Doctor Strong expressed some little"
766 "sense of pain, I thought, under the infliction of these compliments."
766 ""
766 "'Therefore, my dear Doctor,' said the Old Soldier, giving him several"
766 "affectionate taps, 'you may command me, at all times and seasons. Now,"
766 "do understand that I am entirely at your service. I am ready to go with"
766 "Annie to operas, concerts, exhibitions, all kinds of places; and you"
766 "shall never find that I am tired. Duty, my dear Doctor, before every"
766 "consideration in the universe!'"
766 ""
766 "She was as good as her word. She was one of those people who can bear"
766 "a great deal of pleasure, and she never flinched in her perseverance"
766 "in the cause. She seldom got hold of the newspaper (which she settled"
766 "herself down in the softest chair in the house to read through an"
766 "eye-glass, every day, for two hours), but she found out something that"
766 "she was certain Annie would like to see. It was in vain for Annie to"
766 "protest that she was weary of such things. Her mother's remonstrance"
766 "always was, 'Now, my dear Annie, I am sure you know better; and I must"
766 "tell you, my love, that you are not making a proper return for the"
766 "kindness of Doctor Strong.'"
766 ""
766 "This was usually said in the Doctor's presence, and appeared to me to"
766 "constitute Annie's principal inducement for withdrawing her objections"
766 "when she made any. But in general she resigned herself to her mother,"
766 "and went where the Old Soldier would."
766 ""
766 "It rarely happened now that Mr. Maldon accompanied them. Sometimes"
766 "my aunt and Dora were invited to do so, and accepted the invitation."
766 "Sometimes Dora only was asked. The time had been, when I should have"
766 "been uneasy in her going; but reflection on what had passed that"
766 "former night in the Doctor's study, had made a change in my mistrust. I"
766 "believed that the Doctor was right, and I had no worse suspicions."
766 ""
766 "My aunt rubbed her nose sometimes when she happened to be alone with"
766 "me, and said she couldn't make it out; she wished they were happier; she"
766 "didn't think our military friend (so she always called the Old Soldier)"
766 "mended the matter at all. My aunt further expressed her opinion, 'that"
766 "if our military friend would cut off those butterflies, and give 'em to"
766 "the chimney-sweepers for May-day, it would look like the beginning of"
766 "something sensible on her part.'"
766 ""
766 "But her abiding reliance was on Mr. Dick. That man had evidently an"
766 "idea in his head, she said; and if he could only once pen it up into a"
766 "corner, which was his great difficulty, he would distinguish himself in"
766 "some extraordinary manner."
766 ""
766 "Unconscious of this prediction, Mr. Dick continued to occupy precisely"
766 "the same ground in reference to the Doctor and to Mrs. Strong. He seemed"
766 "neither to advance nor to recede. He appeared to have settled into his"
766 "original foundation, like a building; and I must confess that my faith"
766 "in his ever Moving, was not much greater than if he had been a building."
766 ""
766 "But one night, when I had been married some months, Mr. Dick put his"
766 "head into the parlour, where I was writing alone (Dora having gone out"
766 "with my aunt to take tea with the two little birds), and said, with a"
766 "significant cough:"
766 ""
766 "'You couldn't speak to me without inconveniencing yourself, Trotwood, I"
766 "am afraid?'"
766 ""
766 "'Certainly, Mr. Dick,' said I; 'come in!'"
766 ""
766 "'Trotwood,' said Mr. Dick, laying his finger on the side of his nose,"
766 "after he had shaken hands with me. 'Before I sit down, I wish to make an"
766 "observation. You know your aunt?'"
766 ""
766 "'A little,' I replied."
766 ""
766 "'She is the most wonderful woman in the world, sir!'"
766 ""
766 "After the delivery of this communication, which he shot out of himself"
766 "as if he were loaded with it, Mr. Dick sat down with greater gravity"
766 "than usual, and looked at me."
766 ""
766 "'Now, boy,' said Mr. Dick, 'I am going to put a question to you.'"
766 ""
766 "'As many as you please,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'What do you consider me, sir?' asked Mr. Dick, folding his arms."
766 ""
766 "'A dear old friend,' said I. 'Thank you, Trotwood,' returned Mr. Dick,"
766 "laughing, and reaching across in high glee to shake hands with me. 'But"
766 "I mean, boy,' resuming his gravity, 'what do you consider me in this"
766 "respect?' touching his forehead."
766 ""
766 "I was puzzled how to answer, but he helped me with a word."
766 ""
766 "'Weak?' said Mr. Dick."
766 ""
766 "'Well,' I replied, dubiously. 'Rather so.'"
766 ""
766 "'Exactly!' cried Mr. Dick, who seemed quite enchanted by my reply. 'That"
766 "is, Trotwood, when they took some of the trouble out of you-know-who's"
766 "head, and put it you know where, there was a--' Mr. Dick made his two"
766 "hands revolve very fast about each other a great number of times, and"
766 "then brought them into collision, and rolled them over and over one"
766 "another, to express confusion. 'There was that sort of thing done to me"
766 "somehow. Eh?'"
766 ""
766 "I nodded at him, and he nodded back again."
766 ""
766 "'In short, boy,' said Mr. Dick, dropping his voice to a whisper, 'I am"
766 "simple.'"
766 ""
766 "I would have qualified that conclusion, but he stopped me."
766 ""
766 "'Yes, I am! She pretends I am not. She won't hear of it; but I am. I"
766 "know I am. If she hadn't stood my friend, sir, I should have been shut"
766 "up, to lead a dismal life these many years. But I'll provide for her!"
766 "I never spend the copying money. I put it in a box. I have made a will."
766 "I'll leave it all to her. She shall be rich--noble!'"
766 ""
766 "Mr. Dick took out his pocket-handkerchief, and wiped his eyes. He then"
766 "folded it up with great care, pressed it smooth between his two hands,"
766 "put it in his pocket, and seemed to put my aunt away with it."
766 ""
766 "'Now you are a scholar, Trotwood,' said Mr. Dick. 'You are a fine"
766 "scholar. You know what a learned man, what a great man, the Doctor is."
766 "You know what honour he has always done me. Not proud in his wisdom."
766 "Humble, humble--condescending even to poor Dick, who is simple and knows"
766 "nothing. I have sent his name up, on a scrap of paper, to the kite,"
766 "along the string, when it has been in the sky, among the larks. The kite"
766 "has been glad to receive it, sir, and the sky has been brighter with"
766 "it.'"
766 ""
766 "I delighted him by saying, most heartily, that the Doctor was deserving"
766 "of our best respect and highest esteem."
766 ""
766 "'And his beautiful wife is a star,' said Mr. Dick. 'A shining star. I"
766 "have seen her shine, sir. But,' bringing his chair nearer, and laying"
766 "one hand upon my knee--'clouds, sir--clouds.'"
766 ""
766 "I answered the solicitude which his face expressed, by conveying the"
766 "same expression into my own, and shaking my head."
766 ""
766 "'What clouds?' said Mr. Dick."
766 ""
766 "He looked so wistfully into my face, and was so anxious to understand,"
766 "that I took great pains to answer him slowly and distinctly, as I might"
766 "have entered on an explanation to a child."
766 ""
766 "'There is some unfortunate division between them,' I replied. 'Some"
766 "unhappy cause of separation. A secret. It may be inseparable from the"
766 "discrepancy in their years. It may have grown up out of almost nothing.'"
766 ""
766 "Mr. Dick, who had told off every sentence with a thoughtful nod, paused"
766 "when I had done, and sat considering, with his eyes upon my face, and"
766 "his hand upon my knee."
766 ""
766 "'Doctor not angry with her, Trotwood?' he said, after some time."
766 ""
766 "'No. Devoted to her.'"
766 ""
766 "'Then, I have got it, boy!' said Mr. Dick."
766 ""
766 "The sudden exultation with which he slapped me on the knee, and leaned"
766 "back in his chair, with his eyebrows lifted up as high as he could"
766 "possibly lift them, made me think him farther out of his wits than"
766 "ever. He became as suddenly grave again, and leaning forward as before,"
766 "said--first respectfully taking out his pocket-handkerchief, as if it"
766 "really did represent my aunt:"
766 ""
766 "'Most wonderful woman in the world, Trotwood. Why has she done nothing"
766 "to set things right?'"
766 ""
766 "'Too delicate and difficult a subject for such interference,' I replied."
766 ""
766 "'Fine scholar,' said Mr. Dick, touching me with his finger. 'Why has HE"
766 "done nothing?'"
766 ""
766 "'For the same reason,' I returned."
766 ""
766 "'Then, I have got it, boy!' said Mr. Dick. And he stood up before me,"
766 "more exultingly than before, nodding his head, and striking himself"
766 "repeatedly upon the breast, until one might have supposed that he had"
766 "nearly nodded and struck all the breath out of his body."
766 ""
766 "'A poor fellow with a craze, sir,' said Mr. Dick, 'a simpleton, a"
766 "weak-minded person--present company, you know!' striking himself again,"
766 "'may do what wonderful people may not do. I'll bring them together, boy."
766 "I'll try. They'll not blame me. They'll not object to me. They'll not"
766 "mind what I do, if it's wrong. I'm only Mr. Dick. And who minds Dick?"
766 "Dick's nobody! Whoo!' He blew a slight, contemptuous breath, as if he"
766 "blew himself away."
766 ""
766 "It was fortunate he had proceeded so far with his mystery, for we heard"
766 "the coach stop at the little garden gate, which brought my aunt and Dora"
766 "home."
766 ""
766 "'Not a word, boy!' he pursued in a whisper; 'leave all the blame with"
766 "Dick--simple Dick--mad Dick. I have been thinking, sir, for some time,"
766 "that I was getting it, and now I have got it. After what you have said"
766 "to me, I am sure I have got it. All right!' Not another word did Mr."
766 "Dick utter on the subject; but he made a very telegraph of himself for"
766 "the next half-hour (to the great disturbance of my aunt's mind), to"
766 "enjoin inviolable secrecy on me."
766 ""
766 "To my surprise, I heard no more about it for some two or three weeks,"
766 "though I was sufficiently interested in the result of his endeavours;"
766 "descrying a strange gleam of good sense--I say nothing of good feeling,"
766 "for that he always exhibited--in the conclusion to which he had come. At"
766 "last I began to believe, that, in the flighty and unsettled state of his"
766 "mind, he had either forgotten his intention or abandoned it."
766 ""
766 "One fair evening, when Dora was not inclined to go out, my aunt and I"
766 "strolled up to the Doctor's cottage. It was autumn, when there were no"
766 "debates to vex the evening air; and I remember how the leaves smelt like"
766 "our garden at Blunderstone as we trod them under foot, and how the old,"
766 "unhappy feeling, seemed to go by, on the sighing wind."

766 "It was twilight when we reached the cottage. Mrs. Strong was just coming"
766 "out of the garden, where Mr. Dick yet lingered, busy with his knife,"
766 "helping the gardener to point some stakes. The Doctor was engaged with"
766 "someone in his study; but the visitor would be gone directly, Mrs."
766 "Strong said, and begged us to remain and see him. We went into the"
766 "drawing-room with her, and sat down by the darkening window. There was"
766 "never any ceremony about the visits of such old friends and neighbours"
766 "as we were."
766 ""
766 "We had not sat here many minutes, when Mrs. Markleham, who usually"
766 "contrived to be in a fuss about something, came bustling in, with her"

766 "Annie, why didn't you tell me there was someone in the Study!'"

766 "'My dear mama,' she quietly returned, 'how could I know that you desired"
766 "the information?'"
766 ""

766 ""
766 "'BEEN to the Study, my dear!' she returned emphatically. 'Indeed I have!"

766 ""
766 "'In the act, my dear Annie,' repeated Mrs. Markleham, spreading the"

766 "the dear! I must tell you how it was. I really must, in justice to the"
766 "darling--for he is nothing less!--tell you how it was. Perhaps you know,"
766 "Miss Trotwood, that there is never a candle lighted in this house, until"
766 "one's eyes are literally falling out of one's head with being stretched"
766 "to read the paper. And that there is not a chair in this house, in which"
766 "a paper can be what I call, read, except one in the Study. This took me"
766 "to the Study, where I saw a light. I opened the door. In company with"
766 "the dear Doctor were two professional people, evidently connected with"
766 "the law, and they were all three standing at the table: the"
766 "darling Doctor pen in hand. \"This simply expresses then,\" said the"
766 "Doctor--Annie, my love, attend to the very words--\"this simply expresses"
766 "then, gentlemen, the confidence I have in Mrs. Strong, and gives her all"
766 "unconditionally?\" One of the professional people replied, \"And gives her"
766 "all unconditionally.\" Upon that, with the natural feelings of a mother,"
766 "I said, \"Good God, I beg your pardon!\" fell over the door-step, and came"

766 "windows, never cheerful under any circumstances, looked very dismal,"

766 "lost girl, if we spoke to her in a quieter place, aloof from the crowd,"
766 "and where we should be less observed. I advised my companion, therefore,"
766 "that we should not address her yet, but follow her; consulting in this,"
766 "likewise, an indistinct desire I had, to know where she went."
766 ""
766 "He acquiescing, we followed at a distance: never losing sight of her,"
766 "but never caring to come very near, as she frequently looked about."
766 "Once, she stopped to listen to a band of music; and then we stopped too."
766 ""
766 "She went on a long way. Still we went on. It was evident, from the"
766 "manner in which she held her course, that she was going to some fixed"
766 "destination; and this, and her keeping in the busy streets, and I"
766 "suppose the strange fascination in the secrecy and mystery of so"
766 "following anyone, made me adhere to my first purpose. At length she"
766 "turned into a dull, dark street, where the noise and crowd were lost;"
766 "and I said, 'We may speak to her now'; and, mending our pace, we went"
766 "after her."

766 "having encountered her coming towards us; and Westminster Abbey was"
766 "the point at which she passed from the lights and noise of the leading"
766 "streets. She proceeded so quickly, when she got free of the two currents"
766 "of passengers setting towards and from the bridge, that, between this"
766 "and the advance she had of us when she struck off, we were in the narrow"
766 "water-side street by Millbank before we came up with her. At that moment"

766 "and the road begins to lie between a row of houses and the river. As"
766 "soon as she came here, and saw the water, she stopped as if she had come"
766 "to her destination; and presently went slowly along by the brink of the"

766 "All the way here, I had supposed that she was going to some house;"

766 "no farther."

766 "The neighbourhood was a dreary one at that time; as oppressive, sad, and"
766 "solitary by night, as any about London. There were neither wharves nor"
766 "houses on the melancholy waste of road near the great blank Prison. A"
766 "sluggish ditch deposited its mud at the prison walls. Coarse grass and"
766 "rank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity. In one"
766 "part, carcases of houses, inauspiciously begun and never finished,"
766 "rotted away. In another, the ground was cumbered with rusty iron"
766 "monsters of steam-boilers, wheels, cranks, pipes, furnaces, paddles,"
766 "anchors, diving-bells, windmill-sails, and I know not what strange"
766 "objects, accumulated by some speculator, and grovelling in the dust,"
766 "underneath which--having sunk into the soil of their own weight in wet"
766 "weather--they had the appearance of vainly trying to hide themselves."
766 "The clash and glare of sundry fiery Works upon the river-side, arose"
766 "by night to disturb everything except the heavy and unbroken smoke that"
766 "poured out of their chimneys. Slimy gaps and causeways, winding among"
766 "old wooden piles, with a sickly substance clinging to the latter, like"
766 "green hair, and the rags of last year's handbills offering rewards for"
766 "drowned men fluttering above high-water mark, led down through the ooze"
766 "and slush to the ebb-tide. There was a story that one of the pits"
766 "dug for the dead in the time of the Great Plague was hereabout; and"
766 "a blighting influence seemed to have proceeded from it over the whole"
766 "place. Or else it looked as if it had gradually decomposed into that"
766 "nightmare condition, out of the overflowings of the polluted stream."

766 "whose it was, she made but one more effort and dropped down between us."

766 "among the stones, holding her wretched head with both her hands."

766 "occasions,--as when we had a little dinner-party, or a few friends in"
766 "the evening,--and would come tumbling out of the kitchen, with iron"
766 "missiles flying after him. We wanted to get rid of him, but he was very"
766 "much attached to us, and wouldn't go. He was a tearful boy, and broke"
766 "into such deplorable lamentations, when a cessation of our connexion"
766 "was hinted at, that we were obliged to keep him. He had no mother--no"
766 "anything in the way of a relative, that I could discover, except a"
766 "sister, who fled to America the moment we had taken him off her hands;"

766 "a lively perception of his own unfortunate state, and was always rubbing"
766 "his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket, or stooping to blow his nose on"

766 "This unlucky page, engaged in an evil hour at six pounds ten per annum,"

766 "he grew like scarlet beans--with painful apprehensions of the time when"
766 "he would begin to shave; even of the days when he would be bald or grey."

766 "the day after that on which I was obliged to appear against him, he made"
766 "certain revelations touching a hamper in the cellar, which we believed"
766 "to be full of wine, but which had nothing in it except bottles and"
766 "corks. We supposed he had now eased his mind, and told the worst he knew"
766 "of the cook; but, a day or two afterwards, his conscience sustained a"
766 "new twinge, and he disclosed how she had a little girl, who, early every"
766 "morning, took away our bread; and also how he himself had been suborned"
766 "to maintain the milkman in coals. In two or three days more, I was"
766 "informed by the authorities of his having led to the discovery of"
766 "sirloins of beef among the kitchen-stuff, and sheets in the rag-bag. A"
766 "little while afterwards, he broke out in an entirely new direction, and"
766 "confessed to a knowledge of burglarious intentions as to our premises,"
766 "on the part of the pot-boy, who was immediately taken up. I got to be so"
766 "ashamed of being such a victim, that I would have given him any money"
766 "to hold his tongue, or would have offered a round bribe for his being"
766 "permitted to run away. It was an aggravating circumstance in the case"

766 "I sardonically smile at it. In whatever capacity you ask after my"
766 "employer, I beg, without offence to you, to limit my reply to this--that"
766 "whatever his state of health may be, his appearance is foxy: not to"
766 "say diabolical. You will allow me, as a private individual, to"
766 "decline pursuing a subject which has lashed me to the utmost verge of"
766 "desperation in my professional capacity.'"
766 ""
766 "I expressed my regret for having innocently touched upon a theme"

766 "lady, my admiration of her character, my devotion to her for her love"

766 "'It is my fate,' said Mr. Micawber, unfeignedly sobbing, but doing even"
766 "that, with a shadow of the old expression of doing something genteel;"
766 "'it is my fate, gentlemen, that the finer feelings of our nature have"
766 "become reproaches to me. My homage to Miss Wickfield, is a flight of"
766 "arrows in my bosom. You had better leave me, if you please, to walk the"
766 "earth as a vagabond. The worm will settle my business in double-quick"
766 "time.'"
766 ""
766 "Without attending to this invocation, we stood by, until he put up his"
766 "pocket-handkerchief, pulled up his shirt-collar, and, to delude any"
766 "person in the neighbourhood who might have been observing him, hummed a"
766 "tune with his hat very much on one side. I then mentioned--not knowing"
766 "what might be lost if we lost sight of him yet--that it would give me"
766 "great pleasure to introduce him to my aunt, if he would ride out to"
766 "Highgate, where a bed was at his service."

766 "We walked on, arm-in-arm, again; found the coach in the act of starting;"

766 "for the best--so was Traddles, evidently. Mr. Micawber was for the most"
766 "part plunged into deep gloom. He occasionally made an attempt to smarten"
766 "himself, and hum the fag-end of a tune; but his relapses into profound"
766 "melancholy were only made the more impressive by the mockery of a hat"
766 "exceedingly on one side, and a shirt-collar pulled up to his eyes."

766 "We went to my aunt's house rather than to mine, because of Dora's not"

766 "retired to the window, and pulling out his pocket-handkerchief, had a"
766 "mental wrestle with himself."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Dick was at home. He was by nature so exceedingly compassionate of"
766 "anyone who seemed to be ill at ease, and was so quick to find any such"
766 "person out, that he shook hands with Mr. Micawber, at least half-a-dozen"
766 "times in five minutes. To Mr. Micawber, in his trouble, this warmth, on"
766 "the part of a stranger, was so extremely touching, that he could"
766 "only say, on the occasion of each successive shake, 'My dear sir, you"
766 "overpower me!' Which gratified Mr. Dick so much, that he went at it"

766 "At another time I should have been amused by this; but I felt that"

766 "anxiously, in his vacillations between an evident disposition to reveal"
766 "something, and a counter-disposition to reveal nothing, that I was in a"
766 "perfect fever. Traddles, sitting on the edge of his chair, with his eyes"
766 "wide open, and his hair more emphatically erect than ever, stared by"
766 "turns at the ground and at Mr. Micawber, without so much as attempting"
766 "to put in a word. My aunt, though I saw that her shrewdest observation"
766 "was concentrated on her new guest, had more useful possession of her"
766 "wits than either of us; for she held him in conversation, and made it"
766 "necessary for him to talk, whether he liked it or not."

766 "in the balance. My employer--'"

766 "stipendiary emoluments appertaining to my engagement with him, I should"
766 "probably be a mountebank about the country, swallowing a sword-blade,"

766 "not prepared to make voluntarily, I should have taken him up at this"
766 "point, but for the strange proceedings in which I saw him engaged;"
766 "whereof his putting the lemon-peel into the kettle, the sugar into the"
766 "snuffer-tray, the spirit into the empty jug, and confidently attempting"
766 "to pour boiling water out of a candlestick, were among the most"
766 "remarkable. I saw that a crisis was at hand, and it came. He clattered"

766 "of the river with Martha. I had never seen her since, but she had"

766 "her zealous intervention; nor could I infer, from what he told me, that"
766 "any clue had been obtained, for a moment, to Emily's fate. I confess"

766 "and deeper into the belief that she was dead."
766 ""
766 "His conviction remained unchanged. So far as I know--and I believe"
766 "his honest heart was transparent to me--he never wavered again, in his"
766 "solemn certainty of finding her. His patience never tired. And, although"
766 "I trembled for the agony it might one day be to him to have his strong"
766 "assurance shivered at a blow, there was something so religious in it, so"
766 "affectingly expressive of its anchor being in the purest depths of"
766 "his fine nature, that the respect and honour in which I held him were"
766 "exalted every day."
766 ""
766 "His was not a lazy trustfulness that hoped, and did no more. He had"
766 "been a man of sturdy action all his life, and he knew that in all things"

766 "himself. I have known him set out in the night, on a misgiving that the"
766 "light might not be, by some accident, in the window of the old boat,"
766 "and walk to Yarmouth. I have known him, on reading something in the"
766 "newspaper that might apply to her, take up his stick, and go forth on a"
766 "journey of three--or four-score miles. He made his way by sea to Naples,"
766 "and back, after hearing the narrative to which Miss Dartle had assisted"
766 "me. All his journeys were ruggedly performed; for he was always"
766 "steadfast in a purpose of saving money for Emily's sake, when she should"

766 "long. I have tidings for him. Can you come directly?'"
766 ""
766 "My answer was, to pass out at the gate immediately. She made a hasty"

766 "expeditiously on foot."

766 "to drive, she answered, 'Anywhere near Golden Square! And quick!'--then"
766 "shrunk into a corner, with one trembling hand before her face, and the"

766 "she desired to remain quiet, and feeling that it was my own natural"
766 "inclination too, at such a time, I did not attempt to break the silence."
766 "We proceeded without a word being spoken. Sometimes she glanced out of"
766 "the window, as though she thought we were going slowly, though indeed we"
766 "were going fast; but otherwise remained exactly as at first."
766 ""
766 "We alighted at one of the entrances to the Square she had mentioned,"
766 "where I directed the coach to wait, not knowing but that we might have"
766 "some occasion for it. She laid her hand on my arm, and hurried me on"
766 "to one of the sombre streets, of which there are several in that part,"
766 "where the houses were once fair dwellings in the occupation of single"
766 "families, but have, and had, long degenerated into poor lodgings let off"
766 "in rooms. Entering at the open door of one of these, and releasing my"
766 "arm, she beckoned me to follow her up the common staircase, which was"
766 "like a tributary channel to the street."
766 ""
766 "The house swarmed with inmates. As we went up, doors of rooms were"
766 "opened and people's heads put out; and we passed other people on the"
766 "stairs, who were coming down. In glancing up from the outside, before"
766 "we entered, I had seen women and children lolling at the windows over"
766 "flower-pots; and we seemed to have attracted their curiosity, for these"
766 "were principally the observers who looked out of their doors. It was a"
766 "broad panelled staircase, with massive balustrades of some dark wood;"
766 "cornices above the doors, ornamented with carved fruit and flowers; and"
766 "broad seats in the windows. But all these tokens of past grandeur"
766 "were miserably decayed and dirty; rot, damp, and age, had weakened"
766 "the flooring, which in many places was unsound and even unsafe. Some"
766 "attempts had been made, I noticed, to infuse new blood into this"
766 "dwindling frame, by repairing the costly old wood-work here and there"
766 "with common deal; but it was like the marriage of a reduced old noble to"
766 "a plebeian pauper, and each party to the ill-assorted union shrunk away"
766 "from the other. Several of the back windows on the staircase had"
766 "been darkened or wholly blocked up. In those that remained, there was"
766 "scarcely any glass; and, through the crumbling frames by which the bad"
766 "air seemed always to come in, and never to go out, I saw, through other"
766 "glassless windows, into other houses in a similar condition, and looked"
766 "giddily down into a wretched yard, which was the common dust-heap of the"
766 "mansion."
766 ""
766 "We proceeded to the top-storey of the house. Two or three times, by the"
766 "way, I thought I observed in the indistinct light the skirts of a female"
766 "figure going up before us. As we turned to ascend the last flight of"
766 "stairs between us and the roof, we caught a full view of this figure"
766 "pausing for a moment, at a door. Then it turned the handle, and went in."
766 ""
766 "'What's this!' said Martha, in a whisper. 'She has gone into my room. I"
766 "don't know her!'"
766 ""
766 "I knew her. I had recognized her with amazement, for Miss Dartle."
766 ""
766 "I said something to the effect that it was a lady whom I had seen"
766 "before, in a few words, to my conductress; and had scarcely done so,"
766 "when we heard her voice in the room, though not, from where we stood,"
766 "what she was saying. Martha, with an astonished look, repeated her"
766 "former action, and softly led me up the stairs; and then, by a little"
766 "back-door which seemed to have no lock, and which she pushed open with a"
766 "touch, into a small empty garret with a low sloping roof, little better"
766 "than a cupboard. Between this, and the room she had called hers,"
766 "there was a small door of communication, standing partly open. Here we"
766 "stopped, breathless with our ascent, and she placed her hand lightly on"
766 "my lips. I could only see, of the room beyond, that it was pretty large;"
766 "that there was a bed in it; and that there were some common pictures of"
766 "ships upon the walls. I could not see Miss Dartle, or the person whom"
766 "we had heard her address. Certainly, my companion could not, for my"
766 "position was the best. A dead silence prevailed for some moments. Martha"
766 "kept one hand on my lips, and raised the other in a listening attitude."
766 ""
766 "'It matters little to me her not being at home,' said Rosa Dartle"
766 "haughtily, 'I know nothing of her. It is you I come to see.'"
766 ""
766 "'Me?' replied a soft voice."
766 ""
766 "At the sound of it, a thrill went through my frame. For it was Emily's!"
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' returned Miss Dartle, 'I have come to look at you. What? You are"
766 "not ashamed of the face that has done so much?'"
766 ""
766 "The resolute and unrelenting hatred of her tone, its cold stern"
766 "sharpness, and its mastered rage, presented her before me, as if I had"
766 "seen her standing in the light. I saw the flashing black eyes, and the"
766 "passion-wasted figure; and I saw the scar, with its white track cutting"
766 "through her lips, quivering and throbbing as she spoke."
766 ""
766 "'I have come to see,' she said, 'James Steerforth's fancy; the girl who"
766 "ran away with him, and is the town-talk of the commonest people of her"
766 "native place; the bold, flaunting, practised companion of persons like"
766 "James Steerforth. I want to know what such a thing is like.'"
766 ""
766 "There was a rustle, as if the unhappy girl, on whom she heaped these"
766 "taunts, ran towards the door, and the speaker swiftly interposed herself"
766 "before it. It was succeeded by a moment's pause."
766 ""
766 "When Miss Dartle spoke again, it was through her set teeth, and with a"
766 "stamp upon the ground."
766 ""
766 "'Stay there!' she said, 'or I'll proclaim you to the house, and the"
766 "whole street! If you try to evade me, I'll stop you, if it's by the"
766 "hair, and raise the very stones against you!'"
766 ""
766 "A frightened murmur was the only reply that reached my ears. A silence"
766 "succeeded. I did not know what to do. Much as I desired to put an end to"
766 "the interview, I felt that I had no right to present myself; that it was"
766 "for Mr. Peggotty alone to see her and recover her. Would he never come?"
766 "I thought impatiently."
766 ""
766 "'So!' said Rosa Dartle, with a contemptuous laugh, 'I see her at last!"
766 "Why, he was a poor creature to be taken by that delicate mock-modesty,"
766 "and that hanging head!'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh, for Heaven's sake, spare me!' exclaimed Emily. 'Whoever you are,"
766 "you know my pitiable story, and for Heaven's sake spare me, if you would"
766 "be spared yourself!'"
766 ""
766 "'If I would be spared!' returned the other fiercely; 'what is there in"
766 "common between US, do you think!'"
766 ""
766 "'Nothing but our sex,' said Emily, with a burst of tears."
766 ""
766 "'And that,' said Rosa Dartle, 'is so strong a claim, preferred by one"
766 "so infamous, that if I had any feeling in my breast but scorn and"
766 "abhorrence of you, it would freeze it up. Our sex! You are an honour to"
766 "our sex!'"
766 ""
766 "'I have deserved this,' said Emily, 'but it's dreadful! Dear, dear lady,"
766 "think what I have suffered, and how I am fallen! Oh, Martha, come back!"
766 "Oh, home, home!'"
766 ""
766 "Miss Dartle placed herself in a chair, within view of the door, and"
766 "looked downward, as if Emily were crouching on the floor before her."
766 "Being now between me and the light, I could see her curled lip, and her"
766 "cruel eyes intently fixed on one place, with a greedy triumph."
766 ""
766 "'Listen to what I say!' she said; 'and reserve your false arts for your"
766 "dupes. Do you hope to move me by your tears? No more than you could"
766 "charm me by your smiles, you purchased slave.'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh, have some mercy on me!' cried Emily. 'Show me some compassion, or I"
766 "shall die mad!'"
766 ""
766 "'It would be no great penance,' said Rosa Dartle, 'for your crimes. Do"
766 "you know what you have done? Do you ever think of the home you have laid"
766 "waste?'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh, is there ever night or day, when I don't think of it!' cried Emily;"
766 "and now I could just see her, on her knees, with her head thrown back,"
766 "her pale face looking upward, her hands wildly clasped and held out,"
766 "and her hair streaming about her. 'Has there ever been a single minute,"
766 "waking or sleeping, when it hasn't been before me, just as it used to"
766 "be in the lost days when I turned my back upon it for ever and for ever!"
766 "Oh, home, home! Oh dear, dear uncle, if you ever could have known the"
766 "agony your love would cause me when I fell away from good, you never"
766 "would have shown it to me so constant, much as you felt it; but would"
766 "have been angry to me, at least once in my life, that I might have had"
766 "some comfort! I have none, none, no comfort upon earth, for all of them"

766 ""
766 "Rosa Dartle sat looking down upon her, as inflexible as a figure of"
766 "brass. Her lips were tightly compressed, as if she knew that she"
766 "must keep a strong constraint upon herself--I write what I sincerely"
766 "believe--or she would be tempted to strike the beautiful form with"
766 "her foot. I saw her, distinctly, and the whole power of her face and"
766 "character seemed forced into that expression.---Would he never come?"
766 ""
766 "'The miserable vanity of these earth-worms!' she said, when she had so"
766 "far controlled the angry heavings of her breast, that she could trust"
766 "herself to speak. 'YOUR home! Do you imagine that I bestow a thought"
766 "on it, or suppose you could do any harm to that low place, which money"
766 "would not pay for, and handsomely? YOUR home! You were a part of the"

766 "thing your people dealt in.'"

766 "'Oh, not that!' cried Emily. 'Say anything of me; but don't visit"

766 "'I speak,' she said, not deigning to take any heed of this appeal, and"
766 "drawing away her dress from the contamination of Emily's touch, 'I speak"
766 "of HIS home--where I live. Here,' she said, stretching out her hand with"
766 "her contemptuous laugh, and looking down upon the prostrate girl, 'is a"
766 "worthy cause of division between lady-mother and gentleman-son; of grief"
766 "in a house where she wouldn't have been admitted as a kitchen-girl; of"
766 "anger, and repining, and reproach. This piece of pollution, picked up"
766 "from the water-side, to be made much of for an hour, and then tossed"

766 "Rosa Dartle sprang up from her seat; recoiled; and in recoiling struck"
766 "at her, with a face of such malignity, so darkened and disfigured by"
766 "passion, that I had almost thrown myself between them. The blow, which"
766 "had no aim, fell upon the air. As she now stood panting, looking at"
766 "her with the utmost detestation that she was capable of expressing, and"
766 "trembling from head to foot with rage and scorn, I thought I had never"
766 "seen such a sight, and never could see such another."

766 "And so she would, I have no doubt. I would not have trusted her with the"

766 "have much preferred to be the object of the latter. But, when she"
766 "suffered it to break loose, it was only for a moment. She had chained"
766 "it up again, and however it might tear her within, she subdued it to"

766 "'I came here, you pure fountain of love,' she said, 'to see--as I began"

766 "satisfied. Also to tell you, that you had best seek that home of yours,"
766 "with all speed, and hide your head among those excellent people who are"

766 "and thrown away. But, finding you true gold, a very lady, and"
766 "an ill-used innocent, with a fresh heart full of love and"
766 "trustfulness--which you look like, and is quite consistent with your"
766 "story!--I have something more to say. Attend to it; for what I say I'll"
766 "do. Do you hear me, you fairy spirit? What I say, I mean to do!'"

766 "'Hide yourself,' she pursued, 'if not at home, somewhere. Let it be"
766 "somewhere beyond reach; in some obscure life--or, better still, in some"
766 "obscure death. I wonder, if your loving heart will not break, you have"
766 "found no way of helping it to be still! I have heard of such means"
766 "sometimes. I believe they may be easily found.'"

766 "At this signal, the little elephant, with a dexterity that was next to"
766 "marvellous in so small an animal, whisked the chair round with Mr. Omer"
766 "in it, and rattled it off, pell-mell, into the parlour, without touching"

766 "better than any boat-builder in any yard in all that part. There were"
766 "times, she said, of an evening, when he talked of their old life in"

766 "inquiring for Miss Wickfield, at the office of Wickfield and Heep, whose"

766 "on the top of it), when I looked to him for an explanation; so I took"
766 "out my watch, and, as a last resource, counted off the five minutes. My"
766 "aunt, with her own watch in her hand, did the like. When the time was"
766 "expired, Traddles gave her his arm; and we all went out together to the"
766 "old house, without saying one word on the way."
766 ""
766 "We found Mr. Micawber at his desk, in the turret office on the"
766 "ground floor, either writing, or pretending to write, hard. The large"

766 "like a new kind of shirt-frill."

766 "friends. Will you walk in, sir?'"
766 ""
766 "He preceded us to the dining-room--the first room I had entered in that"
766 "house--and flinging open the door of Mr. Wickfield's former office,"

766 "I had not seen Uriah Heep since the time of the blow. Our visit"
766 "astonished him, evidently; not the less, I dare say, because it"
766 "astonished ourselves. He did not gather his eyebrows together, for he"
766 "had none worth mentioning; but he frowned to that degree that he almost"
766 "closed his small eyes, while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to"
766 "his chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise. This was only when we"
766 "were in the act of entering his room, and when I caught a glance at him"
766 "over my aunt's shoulder. A moment afterwards, he was as fawning and as"
766 "humble as ever."

766 "umbly express myself so--friendly towards them as is ever your friends,"
766 "whether or not. Mrs. Copperfield, sir, I hope she's getting on. We have"
766 "been made quite uneasy by the poor accounts we have had of her state,"
766 "lately, I do assure you.'"

766 ""
766 "'Well, sir,' returned my aunt, 'to tell you the truth, I think you are"
766 "pretty constant to the promise of your youth; if that's any satisfaction"

766 "easily satisfied, you know! Not but what myself and Micawber have our"

766 "hardly fit for any occupation, sir. But it's a pleasure as well as a"
766 "duty, I am sure, to work for him. You've not been intimate with Mr."
766 "Wickfield, I think, Mr. Traddles? I believe I've only had the honour of"
766 "seeing you once myself?'"
766 ""
766 "'No, I have not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield,' returned Traddles;"
766 "'or I might perhaps have waited on you long ago, Mr. Heep.'"
766 ""
766 "There was something in the tone of this reply, which made Uriah look at"
766 "the speaker again, with a very sinister and suspicious expression. But,"
766 "seeing only Traddles, with his good-natured face, simple manner, and"
766 "hair on end, he dismissed it as he replied, with a jerk of his whole"
766 "body, but especially his throat:"
766 ""
766 "'I am sorry for that, Mr. Traddles. You would have admired him as much"
766 "as we all do. His little failings would only have endeared him to you"
766 "the more. But if you would like to hear my fellow-partner eloquently"
766 "spoken of, I should refer you to Copperfield. The family is a subject"
766 "he's very strong upon, if you never heard him.'"
766 ""
766 "I was prevented from disclaiming the compliment (if I should have"
766 "done so, in any case), by the entrance of Agnes, now ushered in by Mr."
766 "Micawber. She was not quite so self-possessed as usual, I thought; and"
766 "had evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue. But her earnest cordiality,"
766 "and her quiet beauty, shone with the gentler lustre for it."
766 ""
766 "I saw Uriah watch her while she greeted us; and he reminded me of an"
766 "ugly and rebellious genie watching a good spirit. In the meanwhile,"
766 "some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles; and Traddles,"
766 "unobserved except by me, went out."
766 ""
766 "'Don't wait, Micawber,' said Uriah."
766 ""
766 "Mr. Micawber, with his hand upon the ruler in his breast, stood erect"
766 "before the door, most unmistakably contemplating one of his fellow-men,"
766 "and that man his employer."

766 "'Oho! This is a conspiracy! You have met here by appointment! You are"
766 "playing Booty with my clerk, are you, Copperfield? Now, take care."
766 "You'll make nothing of this. We understand each other, you and me."
766 "There's no love between us. You were always a puppy with a proud"

766 "suddenness with which he dropped it, when he perceived that it was"
766 "useless to him; the malice, insolence, and hatred, he revealed; the leer"
766 "with which he exulted, even at this moment, in the evil he had done--all"

766 "been brought home, within an inch of being run over. I have myself"
766 "directed some attention, during the past week, to the art of baking; and"
766 "my son Wilkins has issued forth with a walking-stick and driven cattle,"
766 "when permitted, by the rugged hirelings who had them in charge, to"

766 "fell back on me, I suppose from old habit, to whomsoever else she might"
766 "address her discourse at starting, 'that the time is come when the past"

766 "the hand, and Mr. Micawber should take my family by the hand; when the"

766 "discussion in our limited circle, \"In what light does my Emma view the"
766 "subject?\" That my papa was too partial, I know; still, on such a point"
766 "as the frigid coldness which has ever subsisted between Mr. Micawber and"

766 "'Precisely so,' assented Mrs. Micawber. 'Now, I may be wrong in my"
766 "conclusions; it is very likely that I am, but my individual impression"
766 "is, that the gulf between my family and Mr. Micawber may be traced to an"
766 "apprehension, on the part of my family, that Mr. Micawber would require"
766 "pecuniary accommodation. I cannot help thinking,' said Mrs. Micawber,"
766 "with an air of deep sagacity, 'that there are members of my family who"
766 "have been apprehensive that Mr. Micawber would solicit them for their"

766 "himself, he is a most untiring man when he works for other people. I"
766 "never saw such a fellow. If he always goes on in the same way, he must"
766 "be, virtually, about two hundred years old, at present. The heat into"
766 "which he has been continually putting himself; and the distracted and"
766 "impetuous manner in which he has been diving, day and night, among"
766 "papers and books; to say nothing of the immense number of letters he has"
766 "written me between this house and Mr. Wickfield's, and often across the"
766 "table when he has been sitting opposite, and might much more easily have"
766 "spoken; is quite extraordinary.'"
766 ""
766 "'Letters!' cried my aunt. 'I believe he dreams in letters!'"
766 ""
766 "'There's Mr. Dick, too,' said Traddles, 'has been doing wonders! As soon"
766 "as he was released from overlooking Uriah Heep, whom he kept in such"
766 "charge as I never saw exceeded, he began to devote himself to Mr."
766 "Wickfield. And really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we"
766 "have been making, and his real usefulness in extracting, and copying,"
766 "and fetching, and carrying, have been quite stimulating to us.'"
766 ""
766 "'Dick is a very remarkable man,' exclaimed my aunt; 'and I always said"
766 "he was. Trot, you know it.'"
766 ""
766 "'I am happy to say, Miss Wickfield,' pursued Traddles, at once with"
766 "great delicacy and with great earnestness, 'that in your absence Mr."
766 "Wickfield has considerably improved. Relieved of the incubus that had"
766 "fastened upon him for so long a time, and of the dreadful apprehensions"
766 "under which he had lived, he is hardly the same person. At times,"
766 "even his impaired power of concentrating his memory and attention on"
766 "particular points of business, has recovered itself very much; and he"
766 "has been able to assist us in making some things clear, that we should"
766 "have found very difficult indeed, if not hopeless, without him. But"
766 "what I have to do is to come to results; which are short enough; not"
766 "to gossip on all the hopeful circumstances I have observed, or I shall"
766 "never have done.' His natural manner and agreeable simplicity made it"
766 "transparent that he said this to put us in good heart, and to enable"
766 "Agnes to hear her father mentioned with greater confidence; but it was"
766 "not the less pleasant for that."
766 ""
766 "'Now, let me see,' said Traddles, looking among the papers on the"
766 "table. 'Having counted our funds, and reduced to order a great mass of"
766 "unintentional confusion in the first place, and of wilful confusion and"
766 "falsification in the second, we take it to be clear that Mr. Wickfield"
766 "might now wind up his business, and his agency-trust, and exhibit no"
766 "deficiency or defalcation whatever.'"

766 "'Oh, thank Heaven!' cried Agnes, fervently."
766 ""
766 "'But,' said Traddles, 'the surplus that would be left as his means of"
766 "support--and I suppose the house to be sold, even in saying this--would"
766 "be so small, not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of pounds,"
766 "that perhaps, Miss Wickfield, it would be best to consider whether he"
766 "might not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been"
766 "receiver. His friends might advise him, you know; now he is free. You"
766 "yourself, Miss Wickfield--Copperfield--I--'"

766 "a friend to whom I am so grateful, and owe so much.'"
766 ""
766 "'I will not say that I recommend it,' observed Traddles. 'I think it"
766 "right to suggest it. No more.'"
766 ""
766 "'I am happy to hear you say so,' answered Agnes, steadily, 'for it gives"
766 "me hope, almost assurance, that we think alike. Dear Mr. Traddles and"
766 "dear Trotwood, papa once free with honour, what could I wish for! I have"
766 "always aspired, if I could have released him from the toils in which he"
766 "was held, to render back some little portion of the love and care I owe"
766 "him, and to devote my life to him. It has been, for years, the utmost"
766 "height of my hopes. To take our future on myself, will be the next"
766 "great happiness--the next to his release from all trust and"
766 "responsibility--that I can know.'"
766 ""
766 "'Have you thought how, Agnes?'"
766 ""
766 "'Often! I am not afraid, dear Trotwood. I am certain of success. So many"
766 "people know me here, and think kindly of me, that I am certain. Don't"
766 "mistrust me. Our wants are not many. If I rent the dear old house, and"
766 "keep a school, I shall be useful and happy.'"
766 ""
766 "The calm fervour of her cheerful voice brought back so vividly, first"
766 "the dear old house itself, and then my solitary home, that my heart was"
766 "too full for speech. Traddles pretended for a little while to be busily"
766 "looking among the papers."
766 ""
766 "'Next, Miss Trotwood,' said Traddles, 'that property of yours.'"
766 ""
766 "'Well, sir,' sighed my aunt. 'All I have got to say about it is, that if"

766 "'or pounds?'"
766 ""
766 "'Five thousand pounds,' said Traddles."
766 ""
766 "'It was all there was,' returned my aunt. 'I sold three, myself. One, I"
766 "paid for your articles, Trot, my dear; and the other two I have by me."
766 "When I lost the rest, I thought it wise to say nothing about that sum,"
766 "but to keep it secretly for a rainy day. I wanted to see how you would"
766 "come out of the trial, Trot; and you came out nobly--persevering,"
766 "self-reliant, self-denying! So did Dick. Don't speak to me, for I find"
766 "my nerves a little shaken!'"
766 ""
766 "Nobody would have thought so, to see her sitting upright, with her arms"
766 "folded; but she had wonderful self-command."

766 "'Then I am delighted to say,' cried Traddles, beaming with joy, 'that we"
766 "have recovered the whole money!'"
766 ""
766 "'Don't congratulate me, anybody!' exclaimed my aunt. 'How so, sir?'"
766 ""
766 "'You believed it had been misappropriated by Mr. Wickfield?' said"
766 "Traddles."
766 ""
766 "'Of course I did,' said my aunt, 'and was therefore easily silenced."
766 "Agnes, not a word!'"
766 ""
766 "'And indeed,' said Traddles, 'it was sold, by virtue of the power of"
766 "management he held from you; but I needn't say by whom sold, or on whose"
766 "actual signature. It was afterwards pretended to Mr. Wickfield, by that"
766 "rascal,--and proved, too, by figures,--that he had possessed himself of"
766 "the money (on general instructions, he said) to keep other deficiencies"
766 "and difficulties from the light. Mr. Wickfield, being so weak and"
766 "helpless in his hands as to pay you, afterwards, several sums of"
766 "interest on a pretended principal which he knew did not exist, made"
766 "himself, unhappily, a party to the fraud.'"
766 ""
766 "'And at last took the blame upon himself,' added my aunt; 'and wrote me"
766 "a mad letter, charging himself with robbery, and wrong unheard of. Upon"
766 "which I paid him a visit early one morning, called for a candle, burnt"
766 "the letter, and told him if he ever could right me and himself, to"
766 "do it; and if he couldn't, to keep his own counsel for his daughter's"
766 "sake.---If anybody speaks to me, I'll leave the house!'"
766 ""
766 "We all remained quiet; Agnes covering her face."
766 ""
766 "'Well, my dear friend,' said my aunt, after a pause, 'and you have"
766 "really extorted the money back from him?'"
766 ""
766 "'Why, the fact is,' returned Traddles, 'Mr. Micawber had so completely"
766 "hemmed him in, and was always ready with so many new points if an"
766 "old one failed, that he could not escape from us. A most remarkable"
766 "circumstance is, that I really don't think he grasped this sum even so"
766 "much for the gratification of his avarice, which was inordinate, as in"
766 "the hatred he felt for Copperfield. He said so to me, plainly. He said"
766 "he would even have spent as much, to baulk or injure Copperfield.'"
766 ""
766 "'Ha!' said my aunt, knitting her brows thoughtfully, and glancing at"
766 "Agnes. 'And what's become of him?'"
766 ""
766 "'I don't know. He left here,' said Traddles, 'with his mother, who had"
766 "been clamouring, and beseeching, and disclosing, the whole time. They"
766 "went away by one of the London night coaches, and I know no more about"
766 "him; except that his malevolence to me at parting was audacious. He"
766 "seemed to consider himself hardly less indebted to me, than to Mr."
766 "Micawber; which I consider (as I told him) quite a compliment.'"
766 ""
766 "'Do you suppose he has any money, Traddles?' I asked."
766 ""
766 "'Oh dear, yes, I should think so,' he replied, shaking his head,"
766 "seriously. 'I should say he must have pocketed a good deal, in one"
766 "way or other. But, I think you would find, Copperfield, if you had an"
766 "opportunity of observing his course, that money would never keep that"
766 "man out of mischief. He is such an incarnate hypocrite, that whatever"
766 "object he pursues, he must pursue crookedly. It's his only compensation"
766 "for the outward restraints he puts upon himself. Always creeping along"
766 "the ground to some small end or other, he will always magnify every"
766 "object in the way; and consequently will hate and suspect everybody that"
766 "comes, in the most innocent manner, between him and it. So the crooked"
766 "courses will become crookeder, at any moment, for the least reason,"
766 "or for none. It's only necessary to consider his history here,' said"
766 "Traddles, 'to know that.'"
766 ""
766 "'He's a monster of meanness!' said my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'Really I don't know about that,' observed Traddles thoughtfully. 'Many"
766 "people can be very mean, when they give their minds to it.'"
766 ""
766 "'And now, touching Mr. Micawber,' said my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'Well, really,' said Traddles, cheerfully, 'I must, once more, give Mr."
766 "Micawber high praise. But for his having been so patient and persevering"
766 "for so long a time, we never could have hoped to do anything worth"
766 "speaking of. And I think we ought to consider that Mr. Micawber did"
766 "right, for right's sake, when we reflect what terms he might have made"
766 "with Uriah Heep himself, for his silence.'"
766 ""
766 "'I think so too,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'Now, what would you give him?' inquired my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'Oh! Before you come to that,' said Traddles, a little disconcerted,"
766 "'I am afraid I thought it discreet to omit (not being able to carry"
766 "everything before me) two points, in making this lawless adjustment--for"
766 "it's perfectly lawless from beginning to end--of a difficult affair."
766 "Those I.O.U.'s, and so forth, which Mr. Micawber gave him for the"
766 "advances he had--'"
766 ""
766 "'Well! They must be paid,' said my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'Yes, but I don't know when they may be proceeded on, or where they"
766 "are,' rejoined Traddles, opening his eyes; 'and I anticipate, that,"
766 "between this time and his departure, Mr. Micawber will be constantly"
766 "arrested, or taken in execution.'"
766 ""
766 "'Then he must be constantly set free again, and taken out of execution,'"
766 "said my aunt. 'What's the amount altogether?'"
766 ""
766 "'Why, Mr. Micawber has entered the transactions--he calls them"
766 "transactions--with great form, in a book,' rejoined Traddles, smiling;"
766 "'and he makes the amount a hundred and three pounds, five.'"
766 ""
766 "'Now, what shall we give him, that sum included?' said my aunt. 'Agnes,"
766 "my dear, you and I can talk about division of it afterwards. What should"
766 "it be? Five hundred pounds?'"
766 ""
766 "Upon this, Traddles and I both struck in at once. We both recommended"
766 "a small sum in money, and the payment, without stipulation to Mr."
766 "Micawber, of the Uriah claims as they came in. We proposed that the"
766 "family should have their passage and their outfit, and a hundred pounds;"
766 "and that Mr. Micawber's arrangement for the repayment of the advances"
766 "should be gravely entered into, as it might be wholesome for him"
766 "to suppose himself under that responsibility. To this, I added the"
766 "suggestion, that I should give some explanation of his character and"
766 "history to Mr. Peggotty, who I knew could be relied on; and that to Mr."
766 "Peggotty should be quietly entrusted the discretion of advancing another"
766 "hundred. I further proposed to interest Mr. Micawber in Mr. Peggotty,"
766 "by confiding so much of Mr. Peggotty's story to him as I might feel"
766 "justified in relating, or might think expedient; and to endeavour to"
766 "bring each of them to bear upon the other, for the common advantage. We"
766 "all entered warmly into these views; and I may mention at once, that the"
766 "principals themselves did so, shortly afterwards, with perfect good will"
766 "and harmony."
766 ""
766 "Seeing that Traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again, I reminded"
766 "him of the second and last point to which he had adverted."
766 ""
766 "'You and your aunt will excuse me, Copperfield, if I touch upon a"
766 "painful theme, as I greatly fear I shall,' said Traddles, hesitating;"
766 "'but I think it necessary to bring it to your recollection. On the day"
766 "of Mr. Micawber's memorable denunciation a threatening allusion was made"
766 "by Uriah Heep to your aunt's--husband.'"
766 ""
766 "My aunt, retaining her stiff position, and apparent composure, assented"
766 "with a nod."
766 ""
766 "'Perhaps,' observed Traddles, 'it was mere purposeless impertinence?'"
766 ""
766 "'No,' returned my aunt."
766 ""
766 "'There was--pardon me--really such a person, and at all in his power?'"
766 "hinted Traddles."
766 ""
766 "'Yes, my good friend,' said my aunt."
766 ""
766 "Traddles, with a perceptible lengthening of his face, explained that he"
766 "had not been able to approach this subject; that it had shared the fate"
766 "of Mr. Micawber's liabilities, in not being comprehended in the terms he"
766 "had made; that we were no longer of any authority with Uriah Heep; and"
766 "that if he could do us, or any of us, any injury or annoyance, no doubt"
766 "he would."
766 ""
766 "My aunt remained quiet; until again some stray tears found their way to"
766 "her cheeks. 'You are quite right,' she said. 'It was very thoughtful to"
766 "mention it.'"
766 ""
766 "'Can I--or Copperfield--do anything?' asked Traddles, gently."
766 ""
766 "'Nothing,' said my aunt. 'I thank you many times. Trot, my dear, a vain"
766 "threat! Let us have Mr. and Mrs. Micawber back. And don't any of you"
766 "speak to me!' With that she smoothed her dress, and sat, with her"
766 "upright carriage, looking at the door."
766 ""
766 "'Well, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber!' said my aunt, when they entered. 'We have"
766 "been discussing your emigration, with many apologies to you for keeping"
766 "you out of the room so long; and I'll tell you what arrangements we"
766 "propose.'"
766 ""
766 "These she explained to the unbounded satisfaction of the"
766 "family,--children and all being then present,--and so much to the"
766 "awakening of Mr. Micawber's punctual habits in the opening stage of"
766 "all bill transactions, that he could not be dissuaded from immediately"
766 "rushing out, in the highest spirits, to buy the stamps for his notes of"
766 "hand. But, his joy received a sudden check; for within five minutes,"

766 "a flood of tears, that all was lost. We, being quite prepared for this"

766 "the relish of an artist, touching them like pictures, looking at them"
766 "sideways, taking weighty notes of dates and amounts in his pocket-book,"
766 "and contemplating them when finished, with a high sense of their"
766 "precious value, was a sight indeed."

766 "'Now, the best thing you can do, sir, if you'll allow me to advise"

766 "shelter of trees or lee walls to be got, we were fain to stop, in a"
766 "sheer impossibility of continuing the struggle."

766 "When the day broke, it blew harder and harder. I had been in Yarmouth"

766 "of country people, coming in from neighbouring villages, who had seen"

766 "salt rain upon us. The water was out, over miles and miles of the flat"

766 "banks, and had its stress of little breakers setting heavily towards us."

766 "at intervals above the rolling abyss, were like glimpses of another"
766 "shore with towers and buildings. When at last we got into the town, the"

766 "holding by people I met, at angry corners. Coming near the beach, I saw,"
766 "not only the boatmen, but half the people of the town, lurking behind"
766 "buildings; some, now and then braving the fury of the storm to look"
766 "away to sea, and blown sheer out of their course in trying to get zigzag"
766 "back."

766 "Grizzled old sailors were among the people, shaking their heads, as they"
766 "looked from water to sky, and muttering to one another; ship-owners,"
766 "excited and uneasy; children, huddling together, and peering into older"
766 "faces; even stout mariners, disturbed and anxious, levelling their"

766 "The tremendous sea itself, when I could find sufficient pause to look at"

766 "rolling in, and, at their highest, tumbled into surf, they looked as if"
766 "the least would engulf the town. As the receding wave swept back with a"
766 "hoarse roar, it seemed to scoop out deep caves in the beach, as if its"

766 "thundered on, and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached the"
766 "land, every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full"

766 "monster. Undulating hills were changed to valleys, undulating valleys"
766 "(with a solitary storm-bird sometimes skimming through them) were lifted"
766 "up to hills; masses of water shivered and shook the beach with a booming"

766 "its shape and place, and beat another shape and place away; the ideal"
766 "shore on the horizon, with its towers and buildings, rose and fell; the"
766 "clouds fell fast and thick; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving of"

766 "Not finding Ham among the people whom this memorable wind--for it is"

766 "with all hands, a few miles away; and that some other ships had been"
766 "seen labouring hard in the Roads, and trying, in great distress, to keep"

766 "long exposure to the fierce wind had confused me. There was that jumble"
766 "in my thoughts and recollections, that I had lost the clear arrangement"
766 "of time and distance. Thus, if I had gone out into the town, I should"
766 "not have been surprised, I think, to encounter someone who I knew must"
766 "be then in London. So to speak, there was in these respects a curious"

766 "returning from Lowestoft by sea, and being lost. This grew so strong"
766 "with me, that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner,"
766 "and ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea"
766 "at all likely? If he gave me the least reason to think so, I would go"

766 "It was reassuring, on such a night, to be told that some of the"
766 "inn-servants had agreed together to sit up until morning. I went to bed,"
766 "exceedingly weary and heavy; but, on my lying down, all such sensations"
766 "vanished, as if by magic, and I was broad awake, with every sense"
766 "refined."
766 ""
766 "For hours I lay there, listening to the wind and water; imagining, now,"
766 "that I heard shrieks out at sea; now, that I distinctly heard the firing"
766 "of signal guns; and now, the fall of houses in the town. I got up,"
766 "several times, and looked out; but could see nothing, except the"
766 "reflection in the window-panes of the faint candle I had left burning,"
766 "and of my own haggard face looking in at me from the black void."
766 ""
766 "At length, my restlessness attained to such a pitch, that I hurried on"
766 "my clothes, and went downstairs. In the large kitchen, where I dimly"
766 "saw bacon and ropes of onions hanging from the beams, the watchers were"
766 "clustered together, in various attitudes, about a table, purposely moved"
766 "away from the great chimney, and brought near the door. A pretty girl,"
766 "who had her ears stopped with her apron, and her eyes upon the door,"
766 "screamed when I appeared, supposing me to be a spirit; but the others"
766 "had more presence of mind, and were glad of an addition to their"
766 "company. One man, referring to the topic they had been discussing, asked"
766 "me whether I thought the souls of the collier-crews who had gone down,"
766 "were out in the storm?"
766 ""
766 "I remained there, I dare say, two hours. Once, I opened the yard-gate,"
766 "and looked into the empty street. The sand, the sea-weed, and the flakes"
766 "of foam, were driving by; and I was obliged to call for assistance"
766 "before I could shut the gate again, and make it fast against the wind."
766 ""
766 "There was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber, when I at length returned"
766 "to it; but I was tired now, and, getting into bed again, fell--off"
766 "a tower and down a precipice--into the depths of sleep. I have an"
766 "impression that for a long time, though I dreamed of being elsewhere and"
766 "in a variety of scenes, it was always blowing in my dream. At length,"
766 "I lost that feeble hold upon reality, and was engaged with two dear"
766 "friends, but who they were I don't know, at the siege of some town in a"
766 "roar of cannonading."
766 ""
766 "The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant, that I could not"
766 "hear something I much desired to hear, until I made a great exertion"
766 "and awoke. It was broad day--eight or nine o'clock; the storm raging, in"
766 "lieu of the batteries; and someone knocking and calling at my door."
766 ""
766 "'What is the matter?' I cried."
766 ""
766 "'A wreck! Close by!'"
766 ""
766 "I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?"
766 ""
766 "'A schooner, from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit and wine. Make"
766 "haste, sir, if you want to see her! It's thought, down on the beach,"
766 "she'll go to pieces every moment.'"
766 ""
766 "The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase; and I wrapped"
766 "myself in my clothes as quickly as I could, and ran into the street."
766 ""
766 "Numbers of people were there before me, all running in one direction, to"
766 "the beach. I ran the same way, outstripping a good many, and soon came"
766 "facing the wild sea."
766 ""
766 "The wind might by this time have lulled a little, though not more"
766 "sensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of, had been diminished"
766 "by the silencing of half-a-dozen guns out of hundreds. But the sea,"
766 "having upon it the additional agitation of the whole night, was"
766 "infinitely more terrific than when I had seen it last. Every appearance"
766 "it had then presented, bore the expression of being swelled; and the"
766 "height to which the breakers rose, and, looking over one another,"
766 "bore one another down, and rolled in, in interminable hosts, was most"
766 "appalling. In the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves,"
766 "and in the crowd, and the unspeakable confusion, and my first breathless"
766 "efforts to stand against the weather, I was so confused that I looked"
766 "out to sea for the wreck, and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the"
766 "great waves. A half-dressed boatman, standing next me, pointed with his"
766 "bare arm (a tattoo'd arrow on it, pointing in the same direction) to the"
766 "left. Then, O great Heaven, I saw it, close in upon us!"
766 ""
766 "One mast was broken short off, six or eight feet from the deck, and lay"
766 "over the side, entangled in a maze of sail and rigging; and all that"
766 "ruin, as the ship rolled and beat--which she did without a moment's"
766 "pause, and with a violence quite inconceivable--beat the side as if it"
766 "would stave it in. Some efforts were even then being made, to cut this"
766 "portion of the wreck away; for, as the ship, which was broadside on,"
766 "turned towards us in her rolling, I plainly descried her people at"
766 "work with axes, especially one active figure with long curling hair,"
766 "conspicuous among the rest. But a great cry, which was audible even"
766 "above the wind and water, rose from the shore at this moment; the sea,"
766 "sweeping over the rolling wreck, made a clean breach, and carried men,"
766 "spars, casks, planks, bulwarks, heaps of such toys, into the boiling"
766 "surge."
766 ""
766 "The second mast was yet standing, with the rags of a rent sail, and"
766 "a wild confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro. The ship had"
766 "struck once, the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear, and then lifted"
766 "in and struck again. I understood him to add that she was parting"
766 "amidships, and I could readily suppose so, for the rolling and beating"
766 "were too tremendous for any human work to suffer long. As he spoke,"
766 "there was another great cry of pity from the beach; four men arose with"
766 "the wreck out of the deep, clinging to the rigging of the remaining"
766 "mast; uppermost, the active figure with the curling hair."
766 ""
766 "There was a bell on board; and as the ship rolled and dashed, like a"
766 "desperate creature driven mad, now showing us the whole sweep of her"
766 "deck, as she turned on her beam-ends towards the shore, now nothing but"
766 "her keel, as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the sea, the bell"
766 "rang; and its sound, the knell of those unhappy men, was borne towards"
766 "us on the wind. Again we lost her, and again she rose. Two men were"
766 "gone. The agony on the shore increased. Men groaned, and clasped their"
766 "hands; women shrieked, and turned away their faces. Some ran wildly"
766 "up and down along the beach, crying for help where no help could be. I"
766 "found myself one of these, frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom"
766 "I knew, not to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes."
766 ""
766 "They were making out to me, in an agitated way--I don't know how,"
766 "for the little I could hear I was scarcely composed enough to"
766 "understand--that the lifeboat had been bravely manned an hour ago, and"
766 "could do nothing; and that as no man would be so desperate as to attempt"
766 "to wade off with a rope, and establish a communication with the shore,"
766 "there was nothing left to try; when I noticed that some new sensation"
766 "moved the people on the beach, and saw them part, and Ham come breaking"

766 "distracted though I was, by a sight so new to me and terrible, the"
766 "determination in his face, and his look out to sea--exactly the same"
766 "look as I remembered in connexion with the morning after Emily's"
766 "flight--awoke me to a knowledge of his danger. I held him back with both"
766 "arms; and implored the men with whom I had been speaking, not to listen"
766 "to him, not to do murder, not to let him stir from off that sand!"
766 ""
766 "Another cry arose on shore; and looking to the wreck, we saw the cruel"

766 "in triumph round the active figure left alone upon the mast."
766 ""
766 "Against such a sight, and against such determination as that of the"
766 "calmly desperate man who was already accustomed to lead half the people"
766 "present, I might as hopefully have entreated the wind. 'Mas'r Davy,'"
766 "he said, cheerily grasping me by both hands, 'if my time is come, 'tis"
766 "come. If 'tan't, I'll bide it. Lord above bless you, and bless all!"
766 "Mates, make me ready! I'm a-going off!'"

766 "I was swept away, but not unkindly, to some distance, where the people"
766 "around me made me stay; urging, as I confusedly perceived, that he was"
766 "bent on going, with help or without, and that I should endanger the"
766 "precautions for his safety by troubling those with whom they rested. I"
766 "don't know what I answered, or what they rejoined; but I saw hurry on"

766 "penetrating into a circle of figures that hid him from me. Then, I saw"
766 "him standing alone, in a seaman's frock and trousers: a rope in his"
766 "hand, or slung to his wrist: another round his body: and several of the"

766 "The wreck, even to my unpractised eye, was breaking up. I saw that she"
766 "was parting in the middle, and that the life of the solitary man upon"
766 "the mast hung by a thread. Still, he clung to it. He had a singular red"
766 "cap on,--not like a sailor's cap, but of a finer colour; and as the few"
766 "yielding planks between him and destruction rolled and bulged, and his"
766 "anticipative death-knell rung, he was seen by all of us to wave it. I"
766 "saw him do it now, and thought I was going distracted, when his action"
766 "brought an old remembrance to my mind of a once dear friend."

766 "Ham watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence of suspended"
766 "breath behind him, and the storm before, until there was a great"
766 "retiring wave, when, with a backward glance at those who held the rope"
766 "which was made fast round his body, he dashed in after it, and in a"
766 "moment was buffeting with the water; rising with the hills, falling"
766 "with the valleys, lost beneath the foam; then drawn again to land. They"
766 "hauled in hastily."

766 "And now he made for the wreck, rising with the hills, falling with the"
766 "valleys, lost beneath the rugged foam, borne in towards the shore,"
766 "borne on towards the ship, striving hard and valiantly. The distance was"
766 "nothing, but the power of the sea and wind made the strife deadly. At"
766 "length he neared the wreck. He was so near, that with one more of his"
766 "vigorous strokes he would be clinging to it,--when a high, green, vast"
766 "hill-side of water, moving on shoreward, from beyond the ship, he seemed"
766 "to leap up into it with a mighty bound, and the ship was gone!"
766 ""
766 "Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a mere cask had been"
766 "broken, in running to the spot where they were hauling in. Consternation"

766 "were cleared for action. I found Mrs. Micawber in the closest and most"
766 "uncompromising of bonnets, made fast under the chin; and in a shawl"
766 "which tied her up (as I had been tied up, when my aunt first received"
766 "me) like a bundle, and was secured behind at the waist, in a strong"

766 "manner; with nothing superfluous about her. Master Micawber was hardly"
766 "visible in a Guernsey shirt, and the shaggiest suit of slops I ever"
766 "saw; and the children were done up, like preserved meats, in impervious"

766 "the terrible event, and it had greatly shocked him; but there could be"
766 "no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret, and he had come to help"

766 "one of the wooden chambers upstairs, with the tide flowing underneath."

766 "folded small, and quite covered with long sums, carefully worked. From"
766 "the glimpse I had of them, I should say that I never saw such sums"
766 "out of a school ciphering-book. These, it seemed, were calculations of"

766 "fourteen days, from that date. For this he had drawn a note-of-hand"

766 "The well-known shops, however, with their cheerful lights, did something"

766 "churchwarden's pew, at the end of the coffee-room, where he kept company"
766 "with a cash-box, a Directory, a Law-list, and other books and papers."

766 "'Not above three years,' said I."

766 "As I followed the chief waiter with my eyes, I could not help thinking"
766 "that the garden in which he had gradually blown to be the flower he"
766 "was, was an arduous place to rise in. It had such a prescriptive,"
766 "stiff-necked, long-established, solemn, elderly air. I glanced about the"
766 "room, which had had its sanded floor sanded, no doubt, in exactly the"
766 "same manner when the chief waiter was a boy--if he ever was a boy,"
766 "which appeared improbable; and at the shining tables, where I saw"
766 "myself reflected, in unruffled depths of old mahogany; and at the lamps,"
766 "without a flaw in their trimming or cleaning; and at the comfortable"
766 "green curtains, with their pure brass rods, snugly enclosing the boxes;"
766 "and at the two large coal fires, brightly burning; and at the rows of"
766 "decanters, burly as if with the consciousness of pipes of expensive old"
766 "port wine below; and both England, and the law, appeared to me to be"
766 "very difficult indeed to be taken by storm. I went up to my bedroom"
766 "to change my wet clothes; and the vast extent of that old wainscoted"
766 "apartment (which was over the archway leading to the Inn, I remember),"
766 "and the sedate immensity of the four-post bedstead, and the indomitable"
766 "gravity of the chests of drawers, all seemed to unite in sternly"
766 "frowning on the fortunes of Traddles, or on any such daring youth. I"
766 "came down again to my dinner; and even the slow comfort of the meal,"
766 "and the orderly silence of the place--which was bare of guests, the Long"
766 "Vacation not yet being over--were eloquent on the audacity of Traddles,"
766 "and his small hopes of a livelihood for twenty years to come."
766 ""
766 "I had seen nothing like this since I went away, and it quite dashed my"
766 "hopes for my friend. The chief waiter had had enough of me. He came near"
766 "me no more; but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters, to"
766 "meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its"
766 "own accord, for he gave no order. The second waiter informed me, in a"
766 "whisper, that this old gentleman was a retired conveyancer living in the"
766 "Square, and worth a mint of money, which it was expected he would leave"
766 "to his laundress's daughter; likewise that it was rumoured that he had"
766 "a service of plate in a bureau, all tarnished with lying by, though more"
766 "than one spoon and a fork had never yet been beheld in his chambers"
766 "by mortal vision. By this time, I quite gave Traddles up for lost; and"
766 "settled in my own mind that there was no hope for him."
766 ""
766 "Being very anxious to see the dear old fellow, nevertheless, I"
766 "dispatched my dinner, in a manner not at all calculated to raise me in"
766 "the opinion of the chief waiter, and hurried out by the back way. Number"
766 "two in the Court was soon reached; and an inscription on the door-post"
766 "informing me that Mr. Traddles occupied a set of chambers on the top"
766 "storey, I ascended the staircase. A crazy old staircase I found it to"
766 "be, feebly lighted on each landing by a club--headed little oil wick,"
766 "dying away in a little dungeon of dirty glass."

766 "In the course of my stumbling upstairs, I fancied I heard a pleasant"

766 "Happening, however, as I stopped to listen, to put my foot in a hole"

766 "else. I therefore knocked again."

766 "A small sharp-looking lad, half-footboy and half-clerk, who was very"

766 "into a little closet of a hall, and next into a little sitting-room;"

766 "stirred the fire with one hand, and pulled at my neck-kerchief with"
766 "the other, under some wild delusion that it was a great-coat. Without"
766 "putting down the poker, he now hugged me again; and I hugged him; and,"
766 "both laughing, and both wiping our eyes, we both sat down, and shook"
766 "hands across the hearth."

766 "more cheerful, amiable, honest, happy, bright-looking bride, I believe"
766 "(as I could not help saying on the spot) the world never saw. I kissed"

766 "'Forgot?' said I."
766 ""
766 "'The girls,' said Traddles. 'Sophy's sisters. They are staying with us."

766 "that tumbled upstairs, Copperfield?'"
766 ""
766 "'It was,' said I, laughing."
766 ""
766 "'Well then, when you tumbled upstairs,' said Traddles, 'I was romping"
766 "with the girls. In point of fact, we were playing at Puss in the Corner."
766 "But as that wouldn't do in Westminster Hall, and as it wouldn't look"
766 "quite professional if they were seen by a client, they decamped. And"
766 "they are now--listening, I have no doubt,' said Traddles, glancing at"
766 "the door of another room."

766 "'I am sorry,' said I, laughing afresh, 'to have occasioned such a"
766 "dispersion.'"

766 "'Upon my word,' rejoined Traddles, greatly delighted, 'if you had seen"
766 "them running away, and running back again, after you had knocked, to"
766 "pick up the combs they had dropped out of their hair, and going on in"
766 "the maddest manner, you wouldn't have said so. My love, will you fetch"

766 "a peal of laughter."
766 ""
766 "'Really musical, isn't it, my dear Copperfield?' said Traddles. 'It's"
766 "very agreeable to hear. It quite lights up these old rooms. To an"
766 "unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life, you"
766 "know, it's positively delicious. It's charming. Poor things, they have"
766 "had a great loss in Sophy--who, I do assure you, Copperfield is, and"
766 "ever was, the dearest girl!--and it gratifies me beyond expression"
766 "to find them in such good spirits. The society of girls is a very"
766 "delightful thing, Copperfield. It's not professional, but it's very"
766 "delightful.'"
766 ""
766 "Observing that he slightly faltered, and comprehending that in the"
766 "goodness of his heart he was fearful of giving me some pain by what he"
766 "had said, I expressed my concurrence with a heartiness that evidently"
766 "relieved and pleased him greatly."
766 ""
766 "'But then,' said Traddles, 'our domestic arrangements are, to say"
766 "the truth, quite unprofessional altogether, my dear Copperfield. Even"
766 "Sophy's being here, is unprofessional. And we have no other place of"
766 "abode. We have put to sea in a cockboat, but we are quite prepared to"
766 "rough it. And Sophy's an extraordinary manager! You'll be surprised how"
766 "those girls are stowed away. I am sure I hardly know how it's done!'"
766 ""
766 "'Are many of the young ladies with you?' I inquired."
766 ""
766 "'The eldest, the Beauty is here,' said Traddles, in a low confidential"
766 "voice, 'Caroline. And Sarah's here--the one I mentioned to you as having"
766 "something the matter with her spine, you know. Immensely better! And the"
766 "two youngest that Sophy educated are with us. And Louisa's here.'"
766 ""
766 "'Indeed!' cried I."
766 ""
766 "'Yes,' said Traddles. 'Now the whole set--I mean the chambers--is only"
766 "three rooms; but Sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonderful way,"
766 "and they sleep as comfortably as possible. Three in that room,' said"
766 "Traddles, pointing. 'Two in that.'"
766 ""
766 "I could not help glancing round, in search of the accommodation"
766 "remaining for Mr. and Mrs. Traddles. Traddles understood me."
766 ""
766 "'Well!' said Traddles, 'we are prepared to rough it, as I said just now,"
766 "and we did improvise a bed last week, upon the floor here. But there's"
766 "a little room in the roof--a very nice room, when you're up there--which"
766 "Sophy papered herself, to surprise me; and that's our room at present."
766 "It's a capital little gipsy sort of place. There's quite a view from"
766 "it.'"
766 ""
766 "'And you are happily married at last, my dear Traddles!' said I. 'How"
766 "rejoiced I am!'"
766 ""
766 "'Thank you, my dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, as we shook hands"
766 "once more. 'Yes, I am as happy as it's possible to be. There's your old"
766 "friend, you see,' said Traddles, nodding triumphantly at the flower-pot"
766 "and stand; 'and there's the table with the marble top! All the other"
766 "furniture is plain and serviceable, you perceive. And as to plate, Lord"
766 "bless you, we haven't so much as a tea-spoon.'"
766 ""
766 "'All to be earned?' said I, cheerfully."
766 ""
766 "'Exactly so,' replied Traddles, 'all to be earned. Of course we have"
766 "something in the shape of tea-spoons, because we stir our tea. But"
766 "they're Britannia metal.'"
766 ""
766 "'The silver will be the brighter when it comes,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'The very thing we say!' cried Traddles. 'You see, my dear Copperfield,'"
766 "falling again into the low confidential tone, 'after I had delivered my"
766 "argument in DOE dem. JIPES versus WIGZIELL, which did me great service"
766 "with the profession, I went down into Devonshire, and had some serious"
766 "conversation in private with the Reverend Horace. I dwelt upon the fact"
766 "that Sophy--who I do assure you, Copperfield, is the dearest girl!--'"
766 ""
766 "'I am certain she is!' said I."
766 ""
766 "'She is, indeed!' rejoined Traddles. 'But I am afraid I am wandering"
766 "from the subject. Did I mention the Reverend Horace?'"
766 ""
766 "'You said that you dwelt upon the fact--'"
766 ""
766 "'True! Upon the fact that Sophy and I had been engaged for a long"
766 "period, and that Sophy, with the permission of her parents, was more"
766 "than content to take me--in short,' said Traddles, with his old frank"
766 "smile, 'on our present Britannia-metal footing. Very well. I then"
766 "proposed to the Reverend Horace--who is a most excellent clergyman,"
766 "Copperfield, and ought to be a Bishop; or at least ought to have enough"
766 "to live upon, without pinching himself--that if I could turn the corner,"
766 "say of two hundred and fifty pounds, in one year; and could see my"
766 "way pretty clearly to that, or something better, next year; and could"
766 "plainly furnish a little place like this, besides; then, and in that"
766 "case, Sophy and I should be united. I took the liberty of representing"
766 "that we had been patient for a good many years; and that the"
766 "circumstance of Sophy's being extraordinarily useful at home, ought not"
766 "to operate with her affectionate parents, against her establishment in"
766 "life--don't you see?'"
766 ""
766 "'Certainly it ought not,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'I am glad you think so, Copperfield,' rejoined Traddles, 'because,"
766 "without any imputation on the Reverend Horace, I do think parents, and"
766 "brothers, and so forth, are sometimes rather selfish in such cases."
766 "Well! I also pointed out, that my most earnest desire was, to be useful"
766 "to the family; and that if I got on in the world, and anything should"
766 "happen to him--I refer to the Reverend Horace--'"
766 ""
766 "'I understand,' said I."
766 ""
766 "'--Or to Mrs. Crewler--it would be the utmost gratification of my"
766 "wishes, to be a parent to the girls. He replied in a most admirable"
766 "manner, exceedingly flattering to my feelings, and undertook to obtain"
766 "the consent of Mrs. Crewler to this arrangement. They had a dreadful"
766 "time of it with her. It mounted from her legs into her chest, and then"
766 "into her head--'"
766 ""
766 "'What mounted?' I asked."
766 ""
766 "'Her grief,' replied Traddles, with a serious look. 'Her feelings"
766 "generally. As I mentioned on a former occasion, she is a very superior"
766 "woman, but has lost the use of her limbs. Whatever occurs to harass"
766 "her, usually settles in her legs; but on this occasion it mounted to the"
766 "chest, and then to the head, and, in short, pervaded the whole system"
766 "in a most alarming manner. However, they brought her through it by"
766 "unremitting and affectionate attention; and we were married yesterday"
766 "six weeks. You have no idea what a Monster I felt, Copperfield, when I"
766 "saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction! Mrs."
766 "Crewler couldn't see me before we left--couldn't forgive me, then, for"
766 "depriving her of her child--but she is a good creature, and has done so"
766 "since. I had a delightful letter from her, only this morning.'"
766 ""
766 "'And in short, my dear friend,' said I, 'you feel as blest as you"
766 "deserve to feel!'"
766 ""
766 "'Oh! That's your partiality!' laughed Traddles. 'But, indeed, I am in a"
766 "most enviable state. I work hard, and read Law insatiably. I get up at"
766 "five every morning, and don't mind it at all. I hide the girls in the"
766 "daytime, and make merry with them in the evening. And I assure you I am"
766 "quite sorry that they are going home on Tuesday, which is the day before"
766 "the first day of Michaelmas Term. But here,' said Traddles, breaking off"
766 "in his confidence, and speaking aloud, 'ARE the girls! Mr. Copperfield,"
766 "Miss Crewler--Miss Sarah--Miss Louisa--Margaret and Lucy!'"
766 ""
766 "They were a perfect nest of roses; they looked so wholesome and fresh."
766 "They were all pretty, and Miss Caroline was very handsome; but there was"
766 "a loving, cheerful, fireside quality in Sophy's bright looks, which was"
766 "better than that, and which assured me that my friend had chosen well."
766 "We all sat round the fire; while the sharp boy, who I now divined had"
766 "lost his breath in putting the papers out, cleared them away again, and"
766 "produced the tea-things. After that, he retired for the night, shutting"
766 "the outer door upon us with a bang. Mrs. Traddles, with perfect pleasure"
766 "and composure beaming from her household eyes, having made the tea, then"
766 "quietly made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire."
766 ""
766 "She had seen Agnes, she told me while she was toasting. 'Tom' had taken"
766 "her down into Kent for a wedding trip, and there she had seen my aunt,"
766 "too; and both my aunt and Agnes were well, and they had all talked of"
766 "nothing but me. 'Tom' had never had me out of his thoughts, she really"
766 "believed, all the time I had been away. 'Tom' was the authority for"
766 "everything. 'Tom' was evidently the idol of her life; never to be shaken"
766 "on his pedestal by any commotion; always to be believed in, and done"
766 "homage to with the whole faith of her heart, come what might."
766 ""
766 "The deference which both she and Traddles showed towards the Beauty,"
766 "pleased me very much. I don't know that I thought it very reasonable;"
766 "but I thought it very delightful, and essentially a part of their"
766 "character. If Traddles ever for an instant missed the tea-spoons that"
766 "were still to be won, I have no doubt it was when he handed the Beauty"
766 "her tea. If his sweet-tempered wife could have got up any self-assertion"
766 "against anyone, I am satisfied it could only have been because she was"
766 "the Beauty's sister. A few slight indications of a rather petted and"
766 "capricious manner, which I observed in the Beauty, were manifestly"
766 "considered, by Traddles and his wife, as her birthright and natural"
766 "endowment. If she had been born a Queen Bee, and they labouring Bees,"
766 "they could not have been more satisfied of that."
766 ""
766 "But their self-forgetfulness charmed me. Their pride in these girls, and"
766 "their submission of themselves to all their whims, was the pleasantest"
766 "little testimony to their own worth I could have desired to see. If"
766 "Traddles were addressed as 'a darling', once in the course of that"
766 "evening; and besought to bring something here, or carry something there,"
766 "or take something up, or put something down, or find something, or fetch"
766 "something, he was so addressed, by one or other of his sisters-in-law,"
766 "at least twelve times in an hour. Neither could they do anything without"
766 "Sophy. Somebody's hair fell down, and nobody but Sophy could put it up."
766 "Somebody forgot how a particular tune went, and nobody but Sophy could"
766 "hum that tune right. Somebody wanted to recall the name of a place in"
766 "Devonshire, and only Sophy knew it. Something was wanted to be written"
766 "home, and Sophy alone could be trusted to write before breakfast in"
766 "the morning. Somebody broke down in a piece of knitting, and no one but"
766 "Sophy was able to put the defaulter in the right direction. They were"
766 "entire mistresses of the place, and Sophy and Traddles waited on them."
766 "How many children Sophy could have taken care of in her time, I can't"
766 "imagine; but she seemed to be famous for knowing every sort of song that"
766 "ever was addressed to a child in the English tongue; and she sang dozens"
766 "to order with the clearest little voice in the world, one after another"
766 "(every sister issuing directions for a different tune, and the Beauty"
766 "generally striking in last), so that I was quite fascinated. The best"
766 "of all was, that, in the midst of their exactions, all the sisters had"
766 "a great tenderness and respect both for Sophy and Traddles. I am sure,"

766 ""
766 "Altogether, it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with pleasure,"

766 "that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment, red-tape, dusty wafers,"
766 "ink-jars, brief and draft paper, law reports, writs, declarations, and"
766 "bills of costs; seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if I had"
766 "dreamed that the Sultan's famous family had been admitted on the roll of"
766 "attorneys, and had brought the talking bird, the singing tree, and the"
766 "golden water into Gray's Inn Hall. Somehow, I found that I had taken"
766 "leave of Traddles for the night, and come back to the coffee-house, with"
766 "a great change in my despondency about him. I began to think he would"
766 "get on, in spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in England."
766 ""
766 "Drawing a chair before one of the coffee-room fires to think about him"
766 "at my leisure, I gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness"
766 "to tracing prospects in the live-coals, and to thinking, as they broke"
766 "and changed, of the principal vicissitudes and separations that had"
766 "marked my life. I had not seen a coal fire, since I had left England"
766 "three years ago: though many a wood fire had I watched, as it crumbled"
766 "into hoary ashes, and mingled with the feathery heap upon the hearth,"

766 "I could think of the past now, gravely, but not bitterly; and could"
766 "contemplate the future in a brave spirit. Home, in its best sense, was"
766 "for me no more. She in whom I might have inspired a dearer love, I had"
766 "taught to be my sister. She would marry, and would have new claimants on"
766 "her tenderness; and in doing it, would never know the love for her that"
766 "had grown up in my heart. It was right that I should pay the forfeit of"
766 "my headlong passion. What I reaped, I had sown."

766 "I was thinking. And had I truly disciplined my heart to this, and could"
766 "I resolutely bear it, and calmly hold the place in her home which she"

766 "with another sip of negus, 'between you and me, sir, that her mother"
766 "died of it--or that tyranny, gloom, and worry have made Mrs. Murdstone"
766 "nearly imbecile. She was a lively young woman, sir, before marriage, and"
766 "their gloom and austerity destroyed her. They go about with her, now,"
766 "more like her keepers than her husband and sister-in-law. That was"
766 "Mrs. Chillip's remark to me, only last week. And I assure you, sir, the"

766 "calmest and slowest manner, 'quite electrified me, by pointing out"
766 "that Mr. Murdstone sets up an image of himself, and calls it the Divine"
766 "Nature. You might have knocked me down on the flat of my back, sir,"
766 "with the feather of a pen, I assure you, when Mrs. Chillip said so. The"
766 "ladies are great observers, sir?'"
766 ""
766 "'Intuitively,' said I, to his extreme delight."

766 "'I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion, sir,' he"
766 "rejoined. 'It is not often that I venture to give a non-medical opinion,"
766 "I assure you. Mr. Murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes, and it"
766 "is said,--in short, sir, it is said by Mrs. Chillip,--that the darker"
766 "tyrant he has lately been, the more ferocious is his doctrine.'"
766 ""
766 "'I believe Mrs. Chillip to be perfectly right,' said I."

766 "'Mrs. Chillip does go so far as to say,' pursued the meekest of little"
766 "men, much encouraged, 'that what such people miscall their religion, is"
766 "a vent for their bad humours and arrogance. And do you know I must say,"
766 "sir,' he continued, mildly laying his head on one side, 'that I DON'T"

766 "our neighbourhood! However, as Mrs. Chillip says, sir, they undergo a"
766 "continual punishment; for they are turned inward, to feed upon their own"
766 "hearts, and their own hearts are very bad feeding. Now, sir, about that"

766 "under his potations of negus, to divert his attention from this topic"
766 "to his own affairs, on which, for the next half-hour, he was quite"
766 "loquacious; giving me to understand, among other pieces of information,"
766 "that he was then at the Gray's Inn Coffee-house to lay his professional"
766 "evidence before a Commission of Lunacy, touching the state of mind of a"
766 "patient who had become deranged from excessive drinking. 'And I assure"
766 "you, sir,' he said, 'I am extremely nervous on such occasions. I could"
766 "not support being what is called Bullied, sir. It would quite unman"

766 "indeed, sir? Really?' and almost immediately called for a candle, and"

766 "secret, under this distress; and being delicate and downcast at the time"
766 "of his last repulse--for it was not the first, by many--pined away"
766 "and died. She left me Agnes, two weeks old; and the grey hair that you"
766 "recollect me with, when you first came.' He kissed Agnes on her cheek."

766 "been Traddles's guide, philosopher, and friend. Our venerable instructor"
766 "was a great deal older, and not improved in appearance. His face was"
766 "as fiery as ever; his eyes were as small, and rather deeper set. The"
766 "scanty, wet-looking grey hair, by which I remembered him, was almost"

766 "great kitchen, where every prisoner's dinner was in course of being set"
766 "out separately (to be handed to him in his cell), with the regularity"
766 "and precision of clock-work. I said aside, to Traddles, that I wondered"
766 "whether it occurred to anybody, that there was a striking contrast"
766 "between these plentiful repasts of choice quality, and the dinners, not"
766 "to say of paupers, but of soldiers, sailors, labourers, the great bulk"
766 "of the honest, working community; of whom not one man in five hundred"
766 "ever dined half so well. But I learned that the 'system' required high"
766 "living; and, in short, to dispose of the system, once for all, I found"
766 "that on that head and on all others, 'the system' put an end to all"

766 "them to be the perfect isolation of prisoners--so that no one man in"

766 "vast amount of profession, varying very little in character: varying"
766 "very little (which I thought exceedingly suspicious), even in words. I"
766 "found a great many foxes, disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible"
766 "grapes; but I found very few foxes whom I would have trusted within"
766 "reach of a bunch. Above all, I found that the most professing men were"
766 "the greatest objects of interest; and that their conceit, their vanity,"
766 "their want of excitement, and their love of deception (which many"

766 "deep, but hard-frozen on the ground. Out at sea, beyond my window, the"
766 "wind blew ruggedly from the north. I had been thinking of it, sweeping"
766 "over those mountain wastes of snow in Switzerland, then inaccessible to"

766 "How well I recollect the wintry ride! The frozen particles of ice,"
766 "brushed from the blades of grass by the wind, and borne across my face;"
766 "the hard clatter of the horse's hoofs, beating a tune upon the ground;"
766 "the stiff-tilled soil; the snowdrift, lightly eddying in the chalk-pit"
766 "as the breeze ruffled it; the smoking team with the waggon of old hay,"
766 "stopping to breathe on the hill-top, and shaking their bells musically;"

766 "We walked, that winter evening, in the fields together; and the blessed"

766 ""
766 "We stood together in the same old-fashioned window at night, when the"

766 "She greeted Agnes heartily, nevertheless; and we were soon in the"
766 "lighted parlour downstairs, at dinner. My aunt put on her spectacles"
766 "twice or thrice, to take another look at me, but as often took them"
766 "off again, disappointed, and rubbed her nose with them. Much to the"
766 "discomfiture of Mr. Dick, who knew this to be a bad symptom."
766 ""
766 "'By the by, aunt,' said I, after dinner; 'I have been speaking to Agnes"

766 ""
766 "I could not discover whether my aunt, in her last short conversation"
766 "with me, had fallen on a pious fraud, or had really mistaken the state"

766 "We were married within a fortnight. Traddles and Sophy, and Doctor and"
