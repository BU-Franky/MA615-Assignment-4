6670 "  Out of the little chapel I burst"
6670 "    Into the fresh night-air again."
6670 "  Five minutes full, I waited first"
6670 "    In the doorway, to escape the rain"
6670 "  That drove in gusts down the common's centre"
6670 "    At the edge of which the chapel stands,"
6670 "  Before I plucked up heart to enter."
6670 "    Heaven knows how many sorts of hands"
6670 "  Reached past me, groping for the latch"
6670 "  Of the inner door that hung on catch"
6670 "  More obstinate the more they fumbled,"
6670 "    Till, giving way at last with a scold"
6670 "  Of the crazy hinge, in squeezed or tumbled"
6670 "    One sheep more to the rest in fold,"
6670 "  And left me irresolute, standing sentry"
6670 "  In the sheepfold's lath-and-plaster entry,"
6670 "  Six feet long by three feet wide,"
6670 "  Partitioned off from the vast inside--"
6670 "    I blocked up half of it at least."
6670 "  No remedy; the rain kept driving."
6670 "    They eyed me much as some wild beast,"
6670 "  That congregation, still arriving,"
6670 "  Some of them by the main road, white"
6670 "  A long way past me into the night,"
6670 "  Skirting the common, then diverging;"
6670 "  Not a few suddenly emerging"
6670 "  From the common's self thro' the paling-gaps"
6670 "  --They house in the gravel-pits perhaps,"
6670 "  Where the road stops short with its safeguard border"
6670 "  Of lamps, as tired of such disorder;--"
6670 "  But the most turned in yet more abruptly"
6670 "    From a certain squalid knot of alleys,"
6670 "  Where the town's bad blood once slept corruptly,"
6670 "    Which now the little chapel rallies"
6670 "  And leads into day again,--its priestliness"
6670 "  Lending itself to hide their beastliness"
6670 "  So cleverly (thanks in part to the mason),"
6670 "  And putting so cheery a whitewashed face on"
6670 "  Those neophytes too much in lack of it,"
6670 "    That, where you cross the common as I did,"
6670 "    And meet the party thus presided,"
6670 "  \"Mount Zion\" with Love-lane at the back of it,"
6670 "  They front you as little disconcerted"
6670 "  As, bound for the hills, her fate averted,"
6670 "  And her wicked people made to mind him,"
6670 "  Lot might have marched with Gomorrah"
6670 "  behind him."

6670 "  Well, from the road, the lanes or the common,"
6670 "  In came the flock: the fat weary woman,"
6670 "  Panting and bewildered, down-clapping"
6670 "    Her umbrella with a mighty report,"
6670 "  Grounded it by me, wry and flapping,"
6670 "    A wreck of whalebones; then, with snort,"
6670 "  Like a startled horse, at the interloper"
6670 "  (Who humbly knew himself improper,"
6670 "  But could not shrink up small enough)"
6670 "  --Round to the door, and in,--the gruff"
6670 "  Hinge's invariable scold"
6670 "  Making my very blood run cold."
6670 "  Prompt in the wake of her, up-pattered"
6670 "  On broken clogs, the many-tattered"
6670 "  Little old-faced peaking sister-turned-mother"
6670 "  Of the sickly babe she tried to smother"
6670 "  Somehow up, with its spotted face,"
6670 "  From the cold, on her breast, the one warm place;"
6670 "  She too must stop, wring the poor ends dry"
6670 "  Of a draggled shawl, and add thereby"
6670 "  Her tribute to the door-mat, sopping"
6670 "  Already from my own clothes' dropping,"
6670 "  Which yet she seemed to grudge I should stand on:"
6670 "    Then, stooping down to take off her pattens,"
6670 "    She bore them defiantly, in each hand one,"
6670 "  Planted together before her breast"
6670 "  And its babe, as good as a lance in rest."
6670 "    Close on her heels, the dingy satins"
6670 "  Of a female something, past me flitted,"
6670 "    With lips as much too white, as a streak"
6670 "    Lay far too red on each hollow cheek;"
6670 "  And it seemed the very door-hinge pitied"
6670 "  All that was left of a woman once,"
6670 "  Holding at least its tongue for the nonce."
6670 "  Then a tall yellow man, like the Penitent Thief,"
6670 "  With his jaw bound up in a handkerchief,"
6670 "  And eyelids screwed together tight,"
6670 "  Led himself in by some inner light."
6670 "  And, except from him, from each that entered,"
6670 "    I got the same interrogation--"
6670 "  \"What, you the alien, you have ventured"
6670 "    \"To take with us, the elect, your station?"
6670 "  \"A carer for none of it, a Gallio!\"--"
6670 "    Thus, plain as print, I read the glance"
6670 "  At a common prey, in each countenance"
6670 "    As of huntsman giving his hounds the tallyho."
6670 "  And, when the door's cry drowned their wonder,"
6670 "    The draught, it always sent in shutting,"
6670 "  Made the flame of the single tallow candle"
6670 "  In the cracked square lantern I stood under,"
6670 "    Shoot its blue lip at me, rebutting"
6670 "  As it were, the luckless cause of scandal:"
6670 "  I verily fancied the zealous light"
6670 "  (In the chapel's secret, too!) for spite"
6670 "  Would shudder itself clean off the wick,"
6670 "  With the airs of a Saint John's Candlestick."
6670 "   [Footnote: See Rev. i. 20.]"
6670 "  There was no standing it much longer."
6670 "  \"Good folks,\" thought I, as resolve grew stronger,"
6670 "  \"This way you perform the Grand-Inquisitor"
6670 "  \"When the weather sends you a chance visitor?"
6670 "  \"You are the men, and wisdom shall die with you,"
6670 "  \"And none of the old Seven Churches vie with you!"
6670 "  \"But still, despite the pretty perfection"
6670 "    \"To which you carry your trick of exclusiveness,"
6670 "  \"And, taking God's word under wise protection,"
6670 "    \"Correct its tendency to diffusiveness,"
6670 "  \"And bid one reach it over hot ploughshares,--"
6670 "    \"Still, as I say, though you've found salvation,"
6670 "  \"If I should choose to cry, as now, 'Shares!'--"
6670 "    \"See if the best of you bars me my ration!"

6670 "    With wizened face in want of soap,"
6670 "    And wet apron wound round his waist like a rope,"
6670 "  (After stopping outside, for his cough was bad,"
6670 "  To get the fit over, poor gentle creature,"
6670 "  And so avoid disturbing the preacher)"
6670 "  --Passed in, I sent my elbow spikewise"
6670 "  At the shutting door, and entered likewise,"
6670 "  Received the hinge's accustomed greeting,"
6670 "    And crossed the threshold's magic pentacle,"
6670 "    And found myself in full conventicle,"
6670 "  --To wit, in Zion Chapel Meeting,"
6670 "  On the Christmas-Eve of 'Forty-nine,"
6670 "    Which, calling its flock to their special clover,"
6670 "    Found all assembled and one sheep over,"
6670 "  Whose lot, as the weather pleased, was mine."

6670 "  Of treasure hid in the Holy Bible,"

6670 "    Not improved by the private dog's-ears and creases,"
6670 "  Having clothed his own soul with, he'd fain see equipt yours,--"
6670 "  So tossed you again your Holy Scriptures."
6670 "  And you picked them up, in a sense, no doubt:"
6670 "    Nay, had but a single face of my neighbours"
6670 "    Appeared to suspect that the preacher's labours"
6670 "  Were help which the world could be saved without,"
6670 "  'Tis odds but I might have borne in quiet"
6670 "  A qualm or two at my spiritual diet,"
6670 "  Or (who can tell?) perchance even mustered"
6670 "    Somewhat to urge in behalf of the sermon:"
6670 "  But the flock sat on, divinely flustered,"
6670 "    Sniffing, methought, its dew of Hermon"
6670 "  With such content in every snuffle,"
6670 "  As the devil inside us loves to ruffle."
6670 "  My old fat woman purred with pleasure,"
6670 "    And thumb round thumb went twirling faster,"
6670 "  While she, to his periods keeping measure,"
6670 "    Maternally devoured the pastor."
6670 "  The man with the handkerchief untied it,"
6670 "  Showed us a horrible wen inside it,"
6670 "  Gave his eyelids yet another screwing,"

6670 "  The shoemaker's lad, discreetly choking,"
6670 "  Kept down his cough. 'Twas too provoking!"

6670 "    More or less perfectly, (who can tell?)"

6670 "  And use his gifts of brain and heart,"
6670 "  Given, indeed, but to keep for ever."

6670 "  That prayed or praised, all unaware"
6670 "  Of its fitness for aught but praise and prayer,"

6670 "  Of the rock from his boundless continent,"
6670 "  Sees, in his power made evident,"
6670 "  Only excess by a million-fold"
6670 "  O'er the power God gave man in the mould."
6670 "  For, note: man's hand, first formed to carry"
6670 "  A few pounds' weight, when taught to marry"
6670 "  Its strength with an engine's, lifts a mountain,"
6670 "    --Advancing in power by one degree;"

6670 "  Man may enlarge or narrow his bed"
6670 "  For the water's play, but the water-head--"
6670 "  How can he multiply or reduce it?"
6670 "    As easy create it, as cause it to cease;"
6670 "  He may profit by it, or abuse it,"
6670 "    But 'tis not a thing to bear increase"
6670 "  As power does: be love less or more"
6670 "    In the heart of man, he keeps it shut"
6670 "    Or opes it wide, as he pleases, but"
6670 "  Love's sum remains what it was before."
6670 "  So, gazing up, in my youth, at love"

6670 "  There sat my friend, the yellow and tall,"
6670 "  With his neck and its wen in the selfsame place;"
6670 "  Yet my nearest neighbour's cheek showed gall."
6670 "    She had slid away a contemptuous space:"
6670 "  And the old fat woman, late so placable,"
6670 "  Eyed me with symptoms hardly mistakable,"
6670 "  Of her milk of kindness turning rancid."
6670 "  In short, a spectator might have fancied"
6670 "  That I had nodded, betrayed by slumber."
6670 "  Yet kept my scat, a warning ghastly,"
6670 "  Through the heads of the sermon, nine in number,"
6670 "  And woke up now at the tenth and lastly."
6670 "  But again, could such disgrace have happened?"
6670 "    Each friend at my elbow had surely nudged it;"
6670 "  And, as for the sermon, where did my nap end?"
6670 "    Unless I heard it, could I have judged it?"
6670 "  Could I report as I do at the close,"
6670 "  First, the preacher speaks through his nose:"
6670 "  Second, his gesture is too emphatic:"
6670 "    Thirdly, to waive what's pedagogic,"
6670 "    The subject-matter itself lacks logic:"
6670 "  Fourthly, the English is ungrammatic."
6670 "  Great news! the preacher is found no Pascal,"
6670 "  Whom, if I pleased, I might to the task call"
6670 "  Of making square to a finite eye"
6670 "  The circle of infinity,"
6670 "  And find so all-but-just-succeeding!"
6670 "  Great news! the sermon proves no reading"
6670 "  Where bee-like in the flowers I bury me,"
6670 "  Like Taylor's the immortal Jeremy!"
6670 "  And now that I know the very worst of him,"
6670 "  What was it I thought to obtain at first of him?"
6670 "  Ha! Is God mocked, as he asks,"
6670 "  Shall I take on me to change his tasks,"
6670 "  And dare, despatched to a river-head"
6670 "    For a simple draught of the element,"
6670 "    Neglect the thing for which he sent,"
6670 "  And return with another thing instead?--"
6670 "  Saying, \"Because the water found"
6670 "  \"Welling up from the underground,"
6670 "  \"Is mingled with the taints of earth,"
6670 "  \"While thou, I know, dost laugh at dearth,"
6670 "  \"And couldst, at wink or word, convulse"
6670 "  \"The world with the leap of a river-pulse,--"
6670 "  \"Therefore I turned from the oozings muddy,"
6670 "    \"And bring thee a chalice I found, instead;"
6670 "  \"See the brave veins in the breccia ruddy!"
6670 "    \"One would suppose that the marble bled."
6670 "  \"What matters the water? A hope I have nursed:"
6670 "    \"The waterless cup will quench my thirst.\""
6670 "  --Better have knelt at the poorest stream"
6670 "  That trickles in pain from the straitest rift!"
6670 "  For the less or the more is all God's gift,"
6670 "  Who blocks up or breaks wide the granite-seam."
6670 "  And here, is there water or not, to drink?"
6670 "  I then, in ignorance and weakness,"
6670 "  Taking God's help, have attained to think"
6670 "  My heart does best to receive in meekness"
6670 "  That mode of worship, as most to his mind,"
6670 "  Where earthly aids being cast behind,"
6670 "  His All in All appears serene"
6670 "  With the thinnest human veil between,"
6670 "  Letting the mystic lamps, the seven,"
6670 "  The many motions of his spirit,"
6670 "  Pass, as they list, to earth from heaven."
6670 "  For the preacher's merit or demerit,"
6670 "  It were to be wished the flaws were fewer"
6670 "  In the earthen vessel, holding treasure"
6670 "  Which lies as safe in a golden ewer;"
6670 "    But the main thing is, does it hold good measure?"
6670 "  Heaven soon sets right all other matters!--"
6670 "    Ask, else, these ruins of humanity,"
6670 "  This flesh worn out to rags and tatters,"
6670 "    This soul at struggle with insanity,"
6670 "  Who thence take comfort--can I doubt?--"
6670 "  Which an empire gained were a loss without."
6670 "  May it be mine! And let us hope"
6670 "  That no worse blessing befall the Pope,"
6670 "  Turned sick at last of to-day's buffoonery,"
6670 "    Of posturings and petticoatings,"
6670 "    Beside his Bourbon bully's gloatings"
6670 "  In the bloody orgies of drunk poltroonery!"
6670 "  Nor may the Professor forego its peace"
6670 "    At Gottingen presently, when, in the dusk"
6670 "  Of his life, if his cough, as I fear, should increase,"
6670 "    Prophesied of by that horrible husk--"
6670 "  When thicker and thicker the darkness fills"
6670 "  The world through his misty spectacles,"
6670 "  And he gropes for something more substantial"
6670 "    Than a fable, myth or personification,--"
6670 "  May Christ do for him what no mere man shall,"
6670 "    And stand confessed as the God of salvation!"
6670 "  Meantime, in the still recurring fear"
6670 "    Lest myself, at unawares, be found,"
6670 "    While attacking the choice of my neighbours round,"
6670 "  With none of my own made--I choose here!"
6670 "  The giving out of the hymn reclaims me;"
6670 "  I have done: and if any blames me,"
6670 "  Thinking that merely to touch in brevity"
6670 "    The topics I dwell on, were unlawful,--"
6670 "  Or worse, that I trench, with undue levity,"
6670 "    On the bounds of the holy and the awful,--"
6670 "  I praise the heart, and pity the head of him,"
6670 "  And refer myself to THEE, instead of him,"
6670 "  Who head and heart alike discernest"
6670 "    Looking below light speech we utter,"
6670 "    When frothy spume and frequent sputter"
6670 "  Prove that the soul's depths boil in earnest!"
6670 "  May truth shine out, stand ever before us!"
6670 "  I put up pencil and join chorus"
6670 "  To Hepzibah Tune, without further apology,"
6670 "    The last five verses of the third section"
6670 "    Of the seventeenth hymn of Whitfield's Collection,"
6670 "  To conclude with the doxology."
